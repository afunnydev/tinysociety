High costs of living have inspired some truly unique living situations over the years. There’s the old school bus turned RV, the tiny homes made of storage containers, and now introducing refurbished train wagons. If you’ve ever seen a vintage rail car, you have to admit that they’re quite captivating. They offer a quaint quality that few structures can provide for your home. They transport you back in time and can become quite the cozy living space. 

Finding a caboose for sale might sound like it would be a challenge, but it just might be the easiest part of the process. As a form of tiny living, you might prefer refurbishing in a rail car over building a tiny house from scratch. Learn how you can turn a deserted train caboose into your dream home!

High costs of living have inspired some truly unique living situations over the years. There’s the old school bus turned RV, the tiny homes made of storage containers, and now introducing refurbished train wagons. If you’ve ever seen a vintage rail car, you have to admit that they’re quite captivating. They offer a quaint quality that few structures can provide for your home. They transport you back in time and can become quite the cozy living space. 

Finding a caboose for sale might sound like it would be a challenge, but it just might be the easiest part of the process. As a form of tiny living, you might prefer refurbishing in a rail car over building a tiny house from scratch. Learn how you can turn a deserted train caboose into your dream home!

## Living In A Train Wagon

There are a number of ways you can transform a train car into your new home. Here are some fine examples to help you find inspiration for your tiny house.

#### A Modern Rail Car

This rail car might look classic on the outside, but the interior has been fully modernized. With a full-sized kitchen and room for four, this tiny house's layout ensures that guests are far from roughing it. If your dream house doesn't include a wood stove or an impossibly small bathroom, then take inspiration from this modern design. 

#### A Tiny House Caboose

For a more rustic way of living, a tiny caboose turned tiny house might be more up your alley. You might not be able to host a dinner party, but something this small would be far easier to power. If you’re looking for a tiny house on wheels, this size might be more suitable for traveling. 

#### A Not-So-Tiny House

The train car you select doesn’t have to be vintage. If you come across a sterling rail that’s out of commission, you might want to jump on it. Not only does it offer more space, but it has the potential to expand an existing structure if you know what you’re doing. It also helps to camouflage the building for those interested in living off the grid. No one would think twice about seeing this house from a distance.

#### A Boxcar Rail Tiny House

Larger than the caboose and smaller than the sterling rail is the boxcar rail. Their high ceilings offer the illusion of open space, and could even be built with a lofted bedroom. Since boxcars are used for shipping, there’s no need to gut them during the restoration process. That tends to be a huge draw for those looking into the tiny house community.

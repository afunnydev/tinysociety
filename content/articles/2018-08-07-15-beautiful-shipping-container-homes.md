Why did I call it the dream scope?

Because, this marvelous container home is built within a $40,000 budget. Built by Benjamin Garcia Saxe in Costa Rica, this home is more spacious than it looks. 

As shipping containers have a lesser width than length, placing two containers side by side can solve the problem.

Yes, your shipping container home will feel like a football field! Okay. Maybe a bit small but perfect! [More info...](https://www.archdaily.com/143332/containers-of-hope-benjamin-garcia-saxe-architecture)

As mentioned in our previous article, How to Find a Tiny House Builder, not all tiny houses are created equal. And by that, we mean that there are some key points to consider before choosing the right builder for your project. Here’s a refresher on the most important points to consider:

* **How long have they been in business?** Go for a more experienced tiny house builder and you’re more likely to get someone who knows what works and what doesn’t.
* **Can they build exactly what I’m looking for?** While some tiny house builders focus on set designs, there are also builders out there who will take your design dreams and make them a reality!
* **What kinds of material do they use?** Take a look at some of the tiny houses they built in the past. Make sure they use quality materials that will make your tiny house last!
* **Have they built a lot of tiny houses?** Tiny house builders often come from other types of building backgrounds, and may not know what’s what (even if they claim to). Make sure they’ve built other tiny houses before.

Ohio remains surprisingly strict in regards to tiny houses, particularly around the major cities. For instance, Cleveland requires the square footage to be no smaller than 950 square feet. Despite the hurdles that tiny house hopefuls face when deciding to downsize, tiny living remains a popular choice--particular outside of the cities. Keep an eye on Ohio for their [ever-changing tiny house laws](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-laws-united-states/)! In the meantime, check out the top tiny house builders in the state to get you inspired.

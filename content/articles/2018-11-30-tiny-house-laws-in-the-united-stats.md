## A Breakdown of States That Allow Tiny Houses

Looking for the next step in joining the Tiny House Movement? You came to the right place. Many people in similar positions have wondered how it‚Äôs possible to live in their tiny house without breaking any laws. Sure, it would be great if it were easy, but once you‚Äôre living worry-free in your tiny home you‚Äôll be glad you took the time to do the research. 

## **The U.S. primary regulation regarding Tiny Houses**

When it comes to deciding where to build your tiny house, there are a few things you need to consider first:

*Laws*

Depending on the type of tiny home you‚Äôre looking for and what state you‚Äôre looking to build in, these can vary greatly. Certain states are more friendly toward the idea of tiny houses and tiny house communities, so it‚Äôs a good idea to figure out the laws specific to your location. Two important factors to consider are your locations building codes and zoning regulations.

*Building Codes*

* It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like. Building codes dictate how your tiny house is built. Here are some of the essentials that your tiny house needs to have to be approved:
* Minimum ceiling height: The common spaces must have a minimum ceiling height of 6 feet 8 inches, while bathrooms can be a minimum of 6 feet 4 inches. 
* Windows: There actually isn‚Äôt a minimum number of windows that need to be in a tiny house. It does however, need to meet the standard requirement for emergency exit points. 
* Plumbing: At least one separate bathroom is required (and we totally understand why!)
* Stairs: Tiny houses need to have stairs or ladders in order to reach loft areas.

*International Building Code (IBC) vs International Residential Code (IRC)*

The IBC refers to the regulations for commercial construction, whereas the IRC refers to the rules for residential construction. You can check with your local building department for the specific requirements for either.

*Zoning Regulations*

Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt park or build your tiny house just anywhere. You will need to check with your local zoning department to find out more about the area where you‚Äôre thinking of building. 

Keep in mind that while there are federal laws and local zoning regulations in place, you can still apply through your local planning commission to build outside of the existing codes. Much of what it comes down to is how tiny house friendly the area where you want to build is. 

## Types of Tiny Houses

* Tiny house on wheels: Legally considered an RV (recreational vehicle). With this type of tiny house, you‚Äôll need to register as an RV and figure out a place to park it. There are plenty of campsites in the States, but keep in mind that most states do not allow full-time residency in an RV unless it is in a designated RV park. Generally, these rules are not always enforced unless you are giving someone something to complain about.

* Tiny house on a foundation: Legally considered an accessory dwelling unit (ADU), these types of houses often come in the form of granny flats or cottages. Because of regulations that prohibit tiny house owners from purchasing land to build a tiny house, you‚Äôre left with the option of building next to an already existing residential dwelling. Time to call up some friends!

## Tiny House laws by states

Whether you‚Äôre a tiny house owner or you‚Äôre interested in becoming one, a common scenario that is bound to arise is ***the need to find a home for your tiny home.***

Finding a place to live in a tiny house isn‚Äôt as easy as one might think. There are currently a number of regulations that tiny house enthusiasts must abide by if their tiny home is to be considered legal in the eyes of the law. 

In the United States, tiny house laws vary not only by state, but also by county. This makes pinpointing laws specific to each state tricky due to inconsistent regulations and codes from one jurisdiction to the next. 

The following information on tiny house laws in the United States should be perceived as guidelines for understanding how tiny house-friendly a particular state is, as regulations and codes are actively changing.  So before you decide on a location to call home, it‚Äôs a good idea to contact your local municipality for the most up-to-date information.

## Alabama

**Tiny House Friendly: 2/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Although tiny houses are not specifically addressed; [Jefferson County](http://www.jccal.org/Sites/Jefferson_County/Documents/Land%20Devlopment/ZoningRegs-071615.pdf) permits accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in certain districts that are no more than 200 square feet. 

According to Alabama Tiny Homes, tiny houses are still in the process of becoming widely accepted. Hopefully counties that allow ADUs will eventually include tiny houses under a similar definition. 

**Links:**

* [Jefferson County ADUs](http://www.jccal.org/Sites/Jefferson_County/Documents/Land%20Devlopment/ZoningRegs-071615.pdf)

## Alaska

**Tiny House Friendly: 4/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Anchorage:

  * Tiny houses on wheels are treated as RVs and restricted to R-5 zones. 	
  * Tiny houses on foundations or manufactured homes, face fewer location restrictions. They will require a conditional use permit and building codes will need to be met. 
  * Tiny homes on municipal property must be connected to water and sewage.

Interest in tiny houses appear strong state-wide, however, there are currently few tiny houses in the state at the present time. At the moment, tiny houses aren‚Äôt ‚Äúofficially‚Äù allowed in the city of Anchorage, but with a conditional use permit it may be possible. Areas around the cities are slightly more flexible, but no specific tiny house building codes exist yet. 

## Arizona

**Tiny House Friendly: 7/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Pima County

  * Tiny houses built on foundations are legal in any zones that allow detached single family dwellings.
  * Tiny houses built on a chassis where the suspension/axle components have been removed and the chassis permanently attached on a permanent foundation will be treated as factory-built buildings allowable only in certain zones.
  * Minimum dwelling/room/ceiling height/windows/door/fixture/accessibility dimensions do not apply.
  * Ladders may replace a staircase to loft areas.
  * Loft areas may have reduced fall protection.
  * Number of electrical circuits may be reduced to reflect loads.
  * Alternative compliance with NFPA 501 for mechanical/electrical systems are recognized.

Pima County has directly addressed regulations surrounding tiny houses in an effort to accommodate those who are interested in downsizing. Coconino County, Arizona is another area that is on its way to supporting the tiny house community. They are currently starting the discussion for tiny house zoning and coding rules. Unfortunately, the rest of Arizona currently does not have regulations for tiny houses at this time. 

## Arkansas

**Tiny House Friendly: 2/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* The city of Walnut Ridge recently voted on restricting homes to a minimum of 600 square feet. 
* Rogers, Arkansas allows tiny homes in a residential area if they‚Äôre built from the ground up on the property with a foundation. 
* Rogers has rezoned a section of lots near Bella Vista Lake Park to allow for the development of tiny houses. 

This state has made it difficult for people who want to live in a tiny house. Some jurisdictions have actually added size restrictions to areas that originally had none. Additionally, most counties in Arkansas view tiny homes on wheels as an RV, and therefore restrict them to an RV or mobile home park. The rezoned lots near Bella Vista Lake Park still have plenty of logistics to work out, but it appears they are headed in the right direction. Overall, it appears that complicated zoning laws have slowed down the development of these potential tiny house communities. 

## California

**Tiny House Friendly: 7/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Most cities in California allow tiny houses as accessory dwelling units (ADUs).
* Fresno is the first city in the country to approve tiny houses on wheels as secondary dwelling units in residential neighborhoods.
* San Francisco is another city that now allows secondary dwelling units.
* California Title 25 does not allow the use of a recreational vehicle to be used as a
* dwelling unit. 
* In response to the Sonoma County wildfires, local ordinances allowed persons displaced by the fire to live in RVs or tiny houses outside the burn zones temporarily and without permits.

A tiny house friendly state, California is also one of the most popular states for nomads living in their vehicles--despite not being legal. The California Health and Safety Code defines a Recreational vehicle as a motor home, travel trailer, truck camper, or camping trailer, with or without motive power, designed for human habitation for recreational purposes. Legal or not, California continues to be popular for people who live in their camper vans. Specifics may vary by city and county, but as a whole, California appears to support living in a tiny house.

## Colorado

**Tiny House Friendly: 6/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Walsenburg, Colorado has made it easier to build a tiny house. They waived minimum square footage, stairway regulations, and reduced the requirement for exit door width. 
* Park County, a popular destination for tiny house enthusiasts, has more specific allowances for tiny houses:**\***

  * Living room of not less than 220 square feet with an additional 100 square feet for every occupant in excess of two people.
  * Separate closet.
  * Kitchen sink, cooking appliance and a refrigeration unit, each having a clear working space of not less than 30 inches.
  * Separate bathroom with a water closet, lavatory, shower and/or bathtub.
  * All light, ventilation and life safety requirements must be met regardless of dwelling size.
  * In cases where the efficiency dwelling unit is not a component of a multi-unit structure, provisions for mechanical equipment (heat, hot water, pressure tank, etc) will be required as well.

**\**Please Note:*** This only applies to stick-built dwellings. Modular and Manufactured dwelling still require a 600 sq. foot footprint at grade level per the Park County Land Use Regulations.

While not recognized on a statewide level, many counties have begun to modify their laws to be tiny house friendly--particularly in the case of accessory dwelling units (ADUs).

## Connecticut

**Tiny House Friendly: 0/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Connecticut is currently looking for someone to advocate for tiny living.
* There are currently no proposals or discussions that would indicate Connecticut is leaning towards tiny home development.

Connecticut is very strict when it comes to tiny houses, RVs, or anything that crowds residential land. Despite the need for affordable housing, the state has very strict zoning regulations that discourage anyone looking to live in a tiny house.

## Delaware

**Tiny House Friendly: 4/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* The state requires owners of tiny houses on wheels to get titles within 30 days of purchase.
* Tiny houses 8ft by 40ft or more than 400 square feet are considered mobile homes by Delaware Department of Motor Vehicles.
* Anything smaller than the dimensions above are considered trailers.

Delaware has no specific regulations for tiny houses to date. There are currently organizations attempting to make tiny houses an option for affordable housing communities. 

## Florida Tiny House Laws

**Tiny House Friendly: 7/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Sarasota county requires a tiny house on wheels that stays in an RV park for more than 45 days to have a foundation.
* St. Petersburg requires the floor area of any accessory dwelling unit to be no less than 375 square feet, and cannot exceed 750 square feet. 
* In Orange county, the minimum square footage of an ADU is 400 feet. 
* Tiny houses on wheels must be registered at a DMV in Florida.

America‚Äôs vacationland is on board and ready to support the tiny house movement. Florida plays host to an abundance of RV parks and tiny house hotels for tiny house enthusiasts to try out. While not every county is in agreement about permitting tiny houses, the majority of Florida appears ready to go tiny. 

## Georgia

**Tiny House Friendly: 8/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Decatur adopted a Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) in 2014 that does not require an ADU (accessory dwelling unit) to have a minimum square footage. 
* In Atlanta, guest houses are currently allowed in all R-1 through R-5 zoning districts. Keep in mind, installing a stove or allowing someone to stay there full-time changes the classification from guest house to ADU. ADUs are only allowed in the R-5 district.
* In most zoning districts, it‚Äôs illegal to rent out an ADU.
* Tiny houses on wheels have yet to be defined in most zoning ordinances.
* Almost all jurisdictions in Georgia abide by the 2012 International Residential Code in terms of building codes.

The tiny house movement is moving faster than local municipalities can change zoning regulations and building codes. A number of Georgia‚Äôs counties are giving tiny houses the nod in interest of demonstrating values of inclusivity through affordability.

* Tiny houses on wheels can be inspected by the [National Organization of Alternative Housing.](http://noahcertified.org/certification/)
* [Atlanta Zoning Codes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ihcbi4a3u3m8i9y/Atlanta%20Zoning%20Code%20Diagnostic%20%28November%202016%29.pdf?dl=0)

## Hawaii

**Tiny House Friendly: 5/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Tiny homeowners can purchase a plot of land for their tiny house.
* Tiny homeowners can find a private party that will allow the tiny home on their land.
* Tiny homes are likely not allowed in areas where there are restrictive covenants (CC&Rs). 
* Tiny houses on wheels need to be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles as a travel trailer. 
* Tiny houses on wheels count as dwelling units, but are subject to strict zoning restrictions.

The Hawaii Tiny House Initiative was launched with the goal of first solving the farm worker housing challenges faced on Hawaii Island. Farm dwellings are allowed by County code on working ag lots, if they are at least 220 square feet with a living area, kitchen and bathroom. Another issue that many Native Hawaiians face are the rising prices of housing and land in a state that relies heavily on tourism. Some people are even forced to camp in the process of looking for an affordable option. Hopefully the tiny house movement will bring about positive change for the people and the state of Hawaii.

## Idaho

**Tiny House Friendly: 7/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Tiny houses must comply with one of the following options:
* Site built: A building constructed at the location where it is to be used. Not intended or designed to be moved.
* Modular building: Any building or building component other than a manufactured home that is of closed construction and either entirely or substantially prefabricated or assembled at a location other than the building site. 
* A structure built in compliance with HUD manufactured home construction and safety standards
* Recreational Vehicle - A motor home, travel trailer, truck camper or camping trailer designed for recreational or emergency human habitation. Park trailers are recreational vehicles. Maximum width is 8¬Ω feet. 
* Minimum 150 square feet for both site built and modular buildings.

Idaho is the first state to discuss RV‚Äôs, manufactured, modular and tiny houses in the same reference document. While there are strict regulations to abide by; Idaho is certainly making decisions in favor of tiny living.

## Illinois

**Tiny House Friendly: 5/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* The state of Illinois allows tiny houses in campgrounds, mobile home parks, and private properties. Beyond that, individual counties have authority over where you can and cannot live in your tiny house. 
* Tiny houses on wheels are classified as a recreational trailer (DMV representative will classify as they see fit.)
* Tiny houses are illegal in Chicago.

As is the case with most major cities, tiny houses are not allowed in Chicago. However, the more rural you get, the more it becomes ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù in regards to tiny houses. 

## Indiana

**Tiny House Friendly: 6/10**

* The state of Indiana allows counties to establish specific building codes.
* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* *Important to note:* They specifically exclude codes that apply to private homes built by the individuals and used for their own occupancy--also known as the Log Cabin Rule. 
* Log Cabin Rule does not protect tiny houses on wheels.
* Locations to consider asking local zoning offices about tiny houses:

  * Indianapolis 
  * Fort Wayne
  * Bloomington
  * South Bend 
  * Evansville
  * Carmel

The Log Cabin Rule appears to exist to honor the traditional housing of the state of Indiana. According to several postings, many communities are willing to open their neighborhoods to tiny houses--even offering areas where they can be placed. Not to mention there are several tiny house communities in Indiana which only adds to tiny house-friendliness of the state. 

## Iowa

**Tiny House Friendly: 3/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* The Council of Iowa Falls adopted changes to City Code that reduces the minimum size for new homes from 600 square feet to 500.

While the tiny house movement is really catching on in metro areas with high housing and land costs, it doesn‚Äôt mean building your tiny house in these places will be easy. The major impediment to tiny houses is found in the local zoning ordinances which dictates minimum square footage or lot sizes. A group that proposed the building of tiny houses on a lot near Des Moines was shot down due to ‚Äúa sense of fear, uncertainty and doubt.‚Äù Despite the apparent resistance to tiny houses in the city, it still may be possible to build in rural areas depending on the local regulations.

## Kansas

**Tiny House Friendly: 6/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Tiny houses built on foundations:

  * Unless stated otherwise, some areas state that at least one room must be 120 square feet and other rooms--except for the kitchen and bathroom--must be at least 50 square feet (according to IRC 2012).
  * The smallest single-dwelling residential district you can build in is RS3 and has a 3,000 square foot minimum lot size.  
  * ADUs are permitted in RS7, RS10, RS20, and RS40 single-dwelling residential districts. They are not permitted in RS5 or RS3 districts.
  * The use of solar power is allowed. Small wind devices are also permitted within setbacks and 35 foot height limit. Propane is regulated by the IFC. A [portable power station](https://outbax.com.au/blogs/post/15-camping-hacks-to-improve-your-outdoor-adventure) provides a reliable and convenient power source for outdoor activities, emergencies, and remote work locations.
  * Composting toilets are not permitted.
* Tiny houses on wheels:

  * Camping in a tiny house is only allowed on an approved campground.
  * No codes currently allow you to park on private land or backyard.

While this state does allow for tiny houses built on foundations, tiny houses on wheels appear to be more difficult to live in legally. Each county has different regulations, so be sure to check with your local municipality.

## Kentucky

**Tiny House Friendly: 5/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Tiny homes are allowed in Louisville Metro provided they apply with the following codes:

  * Permanent/site-built: These tiny homes built on a foundation are reviewed and processed the same as any new home.
  * Prefabricated/modular: Tiny house kits can fall under this category. They are typically fabricated off-site, assembled on-site, and then placed on foundations. Additional documentation and review may be required with this option. If the structure is assembled completely off-site then it would be classified as ‚Äúpre-manufactured,‚Äù and would require prior approval by the state.
  * Portable: Tiny houses on wheels would fall under this category, and would not be intended for permanent placement on a site. Tiny houses on wheels are still subject to zoning requirements.

Conversations are moving forward concerning tiny houses in the state of Kentucky. While Louisville seems to be giving the nod to tiny, other areas have yet to address them officially. Similarly to many other states, the further away from the city you go, the more ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù it becomes to live in a tiny house.

## Louisiana

**Tiny House Friendly: 4/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* All cities in Louisiana are supposed to follow the 2012 International Residential Code (IRC).
* According to the 2012 IRC, one room in the tiny house must measure at least 120 square feet in size. 
* Safety regulations require a loft to have a window and stairs--not a ladder. 
* Stairs, hallways, and doors must be at least 3 feet wide and ceilings must be at least 7 feet tall (including loft areas).

By following the 2012 IRC, building a tiny house with all of the mentioned specifications isn‚Äôt easy. Tiny house enthusiasts are hoping Louisiana will put the previously delayed 2015 IRC into effect. 

## Maine

**Tiny House Friendly: 9/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Maine has created statewide construction guidelines for tiny houses; defining them as a dwelling less than 400 square feet allowing sleeping lofts, permitting ladder access to lofts, and approving skylights as points of emergency egress. 
* It‚Äôs important to note that towns are still able to approve or deny the construction of tiny houses. 
* In most cases, your tiny house built on a permanent foundation needs to comply with Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code.
* Camping in a tiny house on wheels is allowed in North Yarmouth, Maine as long as:

  * When placed on a site for more than 120 days per year, all requirements for residential structures are met. 
  * You do not build on a permanent foundation.
  * It is on the lot existing before the date of the ordinance or larger than 30,000 square feet. 

Maine is one of the leading states in the tiny house movement, as they are the first to have adopted statewide construction guidelines for tiny houses. It's also common to convert old boat houses into tiny houses as a secondary dwelling. Not only are they cute, but they also maintain the New England maritime culture that is so prevalent in the state of Maine.

## Maryland

**Tiny House Friendly: 4/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Tiny houses are not yet acknowledged by the state.
* Laws are more friendly toward tiny houses on foundations, rather than tiny houses on wheels.
* Tiny houses on wheels fall into the category of RV, but the only place they can be parked legally is in a dedicated RV park. Most RV parks have restrictions on length of occupancy. 

While the demand is certainly there, some counties and cities in Maryland have zoning laws in place that greatly restrict people from living in tiny houses. The more rural a tiny homeowner is willing to go, the more likely they will be able to find a place to park or build a tiny house.

## Massachusetts

**Tiny House Friendly: 8/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* ADUs (accessory dwelling units) are allowed in many towns and cities in Massachusetts. See the full list [here.](http://www.masshousingregulations.com/pdf/accessory.pdf)
* Specifications of an ADU are specific to each city or town.
* Nantucket allows a third dwelling of up to 550 square feet.
* Tiny houses on wheels are more difficult because the state hasn‚Äôt clearly addressed or defined what they are. 

While it‚Äôs more difficult to own a tiny house on wheels in Massachusetts, owning a tiny on foundations as an ADU doesn‚Äôt appear to be a problem. Camping in an RV park in a tiny house on wheels shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, however, camping for an extended period of time could be.

## Michigan Tiny House Laws

**Tiny House Friendly: 8/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Briley Township in Northern Michigan has defined a new type of dwelling, and refers to it as an ‚ÄòEconomy Efficient Dwelling.‚Äô

  * Economy Efficient Dwelling is a dwelling that is more than 240 square feet and less than 500 square feet with a minimum side elevation of no less than 12 feet and no more than 20 feet, minimum length of 20 feet and a maximum length of 30 feet built to all Michigan building and sanitary codes and qualifies for a certificate of occupancy.
  * An economy efficient dwelling must be placed on a permanent approved foundation.
  * These homes are allowed in residential 2, forest rec, and agriculture areas.

Michigan has adapted their zoning regulations to be more tiny house-friendly. Affordable housing advocates are pushing for the discussion to get ADUs (accessory dwelling units) legalized in residential areas. 

## Minnesota

**Tiny House Friendly: 7/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* For zoning purposes, there are two common types of tiny houses in Minnesota: RVs and ADUs (accessory dwelling units).
* ADUs on a foundation fall under the same [Minnesota State Building Code](https://www.dli.mn.gov/business/codes-and-laws/2015-minnesota-state-building-codes) as all housing.

While tiny houses are more in demand than ever, finding a place to park or build proves tricky. However, a number of municipalities are in support of tiny homes as an option for the elderly, disabled, or those nearing end of life. 

**Links:**

* [Minnesota State Building Codes ](https://www.dli.mn.gov/business/codes-and-laws/2015-minnesota-state-building-codes)

## Mississippi

**Tiny House Friendly: 4/10**

* There are currently no laws in place that govern tiny houses. 
* Tiny house builders in Mississippi can construct any size tiny, but they usually range between 100 and 900 square feet.
* Some locations to inquire about tiny houses:

  * Jackson
  * Biloxi
  * Hattiesburg
  * Gulfport
  * Tupelo
  * Meridian
  * Vicksburg
  * Southaven

Tiny houses were used as emergency shelters after Hurricane Katrina. Since then, it doesn‚Äôt appear that local governments have taken on tiny houses as permanent housing. There are a number of companies that sell tiny houses in hopes that the trend will spread and they‚Äôll become more widely accepted. 

## Missouri

**Tiny House Friendly: 3/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Tiny houses on wheels fall under the term ‚Äòtravel trailer.‚Äô
* A travel trailer refers to a portable vehicular unit mounted on wheels designed to provide temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, or travel use. 
* They do not require special highway movement permits when drawn by a motorized vehicle, and with a living area of less than 220 square feet, excluding built-in equipment (such as wardrobes, closets, kitchen units or fixtures) and bath and toilet rooms. 
* They are not allowed to be used in a city.
* It is unlawful to park on a street or anywhere public.
* Tiny homes are allowed in the case of a disaster.
* Consider asking local zoning offices about installing tiny homes in cities across Missouri such as:

  * St. Louis
  * Kansas City
  * Springfield
  * Columbia
  * Jefferson City
  * Branson
  * Saint Charles

Missouri is another state that hasn‚Äôt officially addressed tiny houses. However, in many areas, tiny houses are considered travel trailers. Unfortunately, this classification puts restrictions on tiny homes that make it extremely difficult to live legally. 

## Montana

**Tiny House Friendly: 3/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Montana will let you register a self-built tiny house, but you will face similar restrictions to that of an RV or travel trailer. 

Montana could really use tiny houses as a means of affordable housing. Currently tiny houses have not been specifically acknowledged by many local ordinances. 

## Nebraska

**Tiny House Friendly: 6/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Manufactured (mobile) homes built in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development‚Äôs (HUD) Federal Manufactured Home Act. Such homes passing inspection are issued a HUD manufactured home label.
* Modular housing units built in accordance with applicable construction codes, i.e. the International Residential Code and the National Electrical Code adopted by Nebraska. Modular homes meeting the requirements are issued the Nebraska Modular Housing Unit label.
* Recreational vehicles, including motorhomes, park trailers, travel trailers, built in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard on Recreational Vehicles, NFPA 1192 or the Park Model Recreational Vehicle Standard.
* All three types of structures when sold and/or offered for sale in Nebraska are legally required to have affixed to them the appropriate State or Federal label attesting to compliance with the relevant building codes.
* Tiny houses, like all other houses and recreational vehicles, will be subject the zoning requirements of local jurisdictions which vary widely by jurisdiction. 

Nebraska has drafted an official document that references the different types of tiny houses. While the document firmly states that it‚Äôs up to local jurisdictions when it comes to zoning requirements, cities like Lincoln are expected to become more welcoming toward tinys.

## Nevada

**Tiny House Friendly: 7/10**

* Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county.
* Nevada is fairly welcoming towards tiny houses, but individuals must abide by local regulations.
* In Clark County, sheds over 200 square feet require a building permit.
* ADUs (accessory dwelling units) cannot have kitchen or cooking facilities.

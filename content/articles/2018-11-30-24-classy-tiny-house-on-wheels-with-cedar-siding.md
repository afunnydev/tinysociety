## Kitchen

The tiny house kitchen is small but mighty. A two-plate burner fits nicely on the counter top, and an additional counter on the opposite side adds even more space.

## Living Room

On the other end of this tiny house is an area that can be used as a living room. Add a convertible sofa-bed into the space for guests!

A toilet, sink, RV shower, and laundry facilities all fit snugly in the small room behind the kitchen.

## Sleeping Spaces

An airy loft accessible by stairs adds even more room with the addition of an extra floor. There's even enough space for custom clothing storage!

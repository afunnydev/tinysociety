This spacious tiny home comes packed with all the luxuries of a residential home. With three sleeping spaces, this tiny is ready for multi-person families or for having friends over!

## Living Room

When we say this tiny home has space--we mean it. Although still tiny, this tiny home doesn't feel small. Unlike some tiny homes, this one has a dedicated living room space with enough room for a sofa or love seat. 

## Bathroom

Behind a sliding barn door you'll find a full-sized shower, a toilet, and smaller sink. The vanity with mirror adds a luxurious touch to the bathroom.

A nook between the kitchen and bathroom houses the stackable washer and dryer.

## Kitchen

The kitchen has ample storage, as well as full-sized appliances. We also love how much counter space there is for food prep and cooking. 

The stairs that lead to the bedroom loft have cubbies that are great for a small microwave and other essentials.

## Sleeping Spaces

Where do we begin? There are three different options for sleeping in this tiny home. The first is in a loft space located up a small set of stairs, above the bathroom. The next sleeping space is on the couch that can be converted into a bed. Finally, the coolest sleeping space of them all is the elevator bed above the couch. Lots of choices!

The cost of this tiny home is $75000. For more information, contact the builder [here.](http://sunbeartinyhomes.com/)

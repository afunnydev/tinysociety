## Living Room

Nestled beneath the bedroom loft is a cozy space big enough for a couch and TV. Corner shelves conveniently line the area underneath the TV--perfect for stray remotes, candles, or other odds and ends!

## Kitchen

And speaking of a cup of tea; the kitchen area is big for a tiny house and boasts standard-sized appliances. We love the farmhouse sink and wood counter tops!

A full-sized shower, toilet, and sink--it's almost hard to believe this is a tiny house!

## Sleeping Spaces

A secret set of stairs on the gooseneck of the trailer lead to a private space big enough for a queen sized bed. The loft section above the living room can be used as a place to sleep or for storage.

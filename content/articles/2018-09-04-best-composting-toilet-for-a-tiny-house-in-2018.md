    It doesn’t matter where you are; when you go gotta go, you gotta go!
    Composting toilets are the solution when your tiny house is off-grid, in the
    middle of nowhere, and digging a hole isn’t your first choice. While there
    are a lot of different options out there, there’s actually a far shorter

It doesn’t matter where you are; when you go gotta go, you gotta go! Composting toilets are the solution [when your tiny house is off-grid](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/off-grid-living-in-a-tiny-house/), in the middle of nowhere, and digging a hole isn’t your first choice. While there are a lot of different options out there, there’s actually a far shorter list of ones that tick off all the boxes. 

## How do they work?

Composting toilets are waterless, which is why off-grid or eco-conscious tiny house owners love ‘em! After doing your business, you add a scoop of carbon material like sawdust which creates the foundation for compost. High temperatures inside the toilet chamber and the organisms in the ground break down the elements into compost, producing some ultra-rich soil for the backyard!

## What are the benefits of a composting toilet?

The right composting toilet can leave a very small environmental footprint. Today, most new toilets use just under two gallons of water for every flush. If you consider how often an average family uses the toilet each day, we’re talking about a lot of water! 

There are three different types of composting toilets.

## 1. Split Systems

This toilet is split into two sections; the pedestal above the floor, and the tank below. The pedestal is essentially the “throne” aspect, while the tank is positioned below the floor where the waste is turned into compost. 

**Great for:** Homes with bigger families, outhouses, parks; anywhere that it will be used by a larger number of people. 

## 2. Self-Contained Systems

This is a 2-in-1 system where everything is built into the pedestal because there is no room to store a tank.

**Great for:** Tiny homes, RVs, boats.

## 3. Continuous or Batch Systems

These two composting toilet types can then be further categorized into continuous or batch systems. With a continuous system, waste is continuously able to run through and out. In a batch system, different sections are filled and turned into compost at different times. 

## The Ultimate Composting Toilet Buying Guide

![null](/img/screen-shot-2018-09-04-at-13.33.30.png)

There are several things to consider when buying a composting toilet for your tiny home:

* _How often will it be used?_ You may only need a smaller tiny house composting toilet if use is infrequent.
* _How will it be operated?_ You can choose between manually-operated, semi-automatic, or fully-automatic toilets. Which one you decide to buy is really dependent on the person maintaining it. 
* _How big is your bathroom?_ It goes without saying that most [tiny house bathrooms are small](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/10-creative-ideas-for-your-tiny-house-bathroom/). However, composting toilets come in a range of sizes and you’ll want the one that fits in your small space.
* _Do you have electrical power?_ Composting toilets come in electric and non-electric models.

This composting toilet is a top-of-the-line system with a low-profile, streamlined design. This toilet deals with liquid waste differently, as it directs it outdoors instead of into a container. You can either create an outdoor drain pit, or divert it into a container that’s stored on the outer wall of your tiny house. One of the great aspects of this composting toilet is that it uses a weight-sensing trap door that keeps the waste out of sight. No complaints here, this toilet is incredible. The only two things that might make you reconsider, are the hefty price tag and the fact that they are hard to find.

This user-friendly composting toilet was designed by two sailors who needed to go off-grid on their boat. What they created was a toilet that is not only reliable, but affordable. There is no smell at all. Zero. The system doesn’t give off an odor, and neither does the resulting compost! The dry composting system is one of the coolest features on this model. It separates liquid waste from solid waste, which results in zero overwhelming smell. How incredible is that? Aside from needing to lift the whole unit up in order to remove the waste, we really have no complaints about this one!

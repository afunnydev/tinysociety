As mentioned in our previous article,[ Tiny House Builders in Washington](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-buiders-washington/), not all tiny houses are created equal. And by that, we mean that there are some key points to consider before choosing the right builder for your project. Here’s a refresher on the most important aspects to consider:

* **How long have they been in business?** Go for a more experienced tiny house builder and you’re more likely to get someone who knows what works and what doesn’t.
* Can they build exactly what I’m looking for? While some tiny house builders focus on set designs, there are also builders out there who will take your design dreams and make them a reality!
* **What kinds of material do they use?** Take a look at some of the tiny houses they built in the past. Make sure they use quality materials that will make your tiny house last!
* **Have they built a lot of tiny houses?** Tiny house builders often come from other types of building backgrounds, and may not know what’s what (even if they claim to). Make sure they’ve built other tiny houses before.

Massachusets remains a State where regulations regarding tiny houses are not too strict! For instance, it is generally easier to build a tiny house if it is on fixed foundations in this State since a lot of counties and cities accept accessory dwelling units! You can get a [list of those cities here.](http://www.masshousingregulations.com/pdf/accessory.pdf) Tiny houses on wheels are trickier since it has not been decided how they are considered legally. You can check our article about [tiny house laws in the US](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-laws-united-states/) for more information regarding regulation in this state!

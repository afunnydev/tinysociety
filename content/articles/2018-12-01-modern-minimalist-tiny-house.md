## Kitchen

This tiny house kitchen is micro but can hold everything you need. A hanging drying rack keeps everything off the surfaces and reduces clutter.

## Living Room

Just inside the front door is a cushioned bench which is a great spot for reading a book or catching up with a friend. Natural light from the window plays off the white walls and visually opens up the space.

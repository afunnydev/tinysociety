Picture this. You wake up in the morning and walk down a short flight of stairs from the cosy loft to the kitchen. A light rain begins to fall as you perch yourself at the breakfast bar overlooking a quiet lake. You smile to yourself--maybe tomorrow I’ll wake up by the sea.

There is something so enchanting about a tiny home. Whether you’re interested in a tiny house on wheels or just to downsize, The idea of a simpler life is incredibly appealing. Not yet sold on the tiny house lifestyle? You will be after checking out the different types of tiny houses that exist. Really though, there are so many great options you will want to move in immediately. 

## Tiny Houses On Foundations

When you picture a tiny house, you often think of a structure built on a trailer. Inhabiting a trailer can be fairly tricky; there are different laws for different areas you may be parked in, as well as limited building space. Fortunately enough, there are a few popular options if you’re looking to build on a piece of land. 

*Building on a foundation*

Like a “typical” house, you could choose to build your tiny home on a concrete foundation. With this option, you get quite a bit of design freedom. May be adding your own visuals, branding, and [create a logo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logo-maker-logo-designer/id1332661961) from a [logo maker](https://www.brandcrowd.com/logo-maker). You could further enhance the uniqueness of your tiny home by incorporating personalized elements like a [logo generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bg.logomaker).

*Building on skids or runners*

If you don’t own a piece of land, building a semi-permanent foundation is an option if you are planning on having to move your tiny house at some point.

## Tiny Houses On Wheels

You can wake up in a new place every single day--what more is there to say? While there are a few things to consider such as housing regulations and power sources, the freedom of the road is what attracts so many to these types of tiny houses. Opting for a house on wheels means that you will never leave home no matter how far you go.

Whether you're designing a bespoke garden room to match the aesthetic of your tiny house or creating a standalone retreat, these structures are versatile and stylish. To explore beautifully crafted options, check out [Custom Garden Rooms](https://customgardenrooms.com/).

## Small Mobile Homes

Also known as trailers or manufactured housing, these tiny homes are known for their affordable housing rates. While the image that trailers have in the United States [isn’t all that positive](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24135022), the ability to move the house and a lower cost of living is what drives their popularity.

Today, motorhomes can be just like tiny houses; compact and simple without sacrificing on comfort or design.

## Gypsy Wagons

Reminiscent of the beautiful horse drawn caravans that were once ([and still are](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/21/iain-mckell_n_4110136.html)) central to Gypsy life.

A shed? Like, a garden shed? Yes, you would be correct. What you may use to keep your tools or gardening equipment in could also be the perfect foundation for a tiny home.

## Tiny Cabin

When we think of a cabin, we often think of a wooded retreat with no phones and no electricity. We envision small houses made of rich-smelling wood with gorgeous fireplaces and an endless supply of firewood in the backyard (and frontyard). Today, cabins have gotten even more rustic-chic. You can even purchase custom-built [cabins on wheels](http://www.tinyportablecedarcabins.com/) in case you need to make a quick getaway!

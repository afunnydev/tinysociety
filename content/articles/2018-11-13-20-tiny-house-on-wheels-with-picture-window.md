## Living Room

A V-shaped, floating staircase leads to the living room loft in one direction, and the bedroom loft in the other. The living room space has a den-like feel; a rectangular window keeps it from feeling too enclosed.

## Kitchen

A small kitchen with a sink, one counter top, a small fridge, and space for other kitchen essentials. Anyone looking to really downsize will love this tiny house because it truly has room for everything you need and nothing you don't.

## Bathroom

Just past a stackable washer-dryer is the tiny house bathroom. Although small in size, this bathroom has everything you would need and nothing extra. In this bathroom is a toilet, shower, and narrow sink.

## Sleeping Spaces

The V-staircase leads to a loft bedroom with enough room for a bed and not much else--although this shouldn't present a problem, because there are several handy cubbies just under the stairs.

When you picture a tiny house, most likely you imagine one that has been built on a trailer. While wheels are an ideal solution for those who enjoy traveling, they’re not for everyone. Many people can’t live in a home without a backyard they can garden in or where their dogs can run around. This had led to a new tiny house trend that has attracted those who enjoy a traditional home as well as the tiny lifestyle. Here’s why tiny houses on foundations are growing in popularity.

## The Benefits of Tiny Houses on Foundations

Unless you plan to take your house on the road, there’s really no reason to build your tiny house on wheels. Choosing to build on a foundation is not only a preference for some people, but it comes with a number of benefits as well. If you’re interested in constructing a tiny house on a foundation, here are some things you can look forward to. 

### Owning Your Land

When you plan to build tiny houses on foundations, you will need to buy a piece of land. Renting land might be an option for you, but it’s considered a risky one. If at some point down the line the landowner decides to sell or that they need to use the land, you can lose your tiny house. So, in these kinds of situations, it’s usually better to buy. Depending on how big or small the land is, you can get a great deal. Some cities will sell small vacant lots for under $1,000. 

### Property Will Appreciate In Value

By owning a piece of land and building a structure on it, the property will likely appreciate in value. This is especially important if you are building a temporary home. Unlike a tiny house on wheels, which depreciates over the years, a home built on a foundation is considered an investment. If selling it is in your plan for the future, even a rundown house will hold some value because of the land. As long as the foundation is in good standing, people will want to buy the property.  

### Easier to Get a Loan

Most banks won’t consider lending someone money to build a tiny house on wheels. This is because they tend to depreciate in value and deteriorate after years of use. Banks want to invest in the construction of homes that they can resell if the loan isn’t paid back. It’s also harder to foreclose on a house when it’s always on the move.

### Less Maintenance

Since people who build tiny homes on trailers are traveling frequently, the house will experience a lot of wear and tear. More than any tiny houses on foundations. The wheels and trailer alone will require regular attention. Not to mention the home’s siding, which will require maintenance after having to withstand all of the rocks and gravel that kick up while you’re on the road. None of this is an issue when you build a home on a foundation. Instead, your areas of maintenance revolve more around taking care of your property such as mowing your lawn and trimming your bushes.

### Use Traditional Utility Hookups

When you live in a tiny house on wheels, things like plumbing and electricity have to be taken into consideration. Rather than being able to hook up to the city grid, you’ll need to come up with alternatives if you want your home to be mobile. This means using compost toilets, solar power, and water tanks. Building a tiny house on a foundation gives you the option to hook up to the grid so that you can have traditional plumbing, electricity, and the most important utility, WiFi. 

## Different Types of Tiny Houses on Foundations

When you decide to build your tiny house on a foundation, you have several options to choose from including slab, crawlspace, basement, or on piers. While other building foundations exist, these are the few most suitable for a smaller construction like a tiny house. 

### Slab Foundation

A slab foundation is pretty basic. As its description indicates, it’s a slab of concrete poured directly onto the ground. This is ideal for homes close to the shores as water levels tend to be higher, so they can’t be constructed with basements.

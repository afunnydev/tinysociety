So, you’ve found the perfect tiny house to call home. What happens next?

## Tiny house financing

Typically less than 500 square feet, [tiny houses cost far less](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-much-money-does-a-tiny-house-cost/) than the average residential home. Despite the tinier price tag, it still may not be possible to pay the total cost all at once. This is where tiny house financing comes in. 

Purchasing a residential home typically works by getting a mortgage. Today, buying a tiny house doesn’t work this way for two reasons:

* A tiny house doesn’t cost enough to be approved for a mortgage loan.
* A mortgage is only approved for a home that is on a permanent foundation (an issue for a tiny house on wheels).

## Helpful Terms to Know

Take a look at these commonly used financial terms and phrases to better understand your options. 



## Ways to Finance Your Tiny House

**Get approved for a loan through a tiny house builder or lender.** Finance your tiny house either directly through a loan provider, or through a loan provider that is partnered with a tiny house builder.

**Apply for a traditional mortgage.** If you’re looking to building an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) next to your house, then this might be the best option for you. Your ADU will likely need to be on foundations, as well as meet your local building codes and zoning requirements. 

**Start an online fundraiser.** Before you roll your eyes at this one, keep in mind that financing a chunk of your tiny house is possible through fundraising. It’s not uncommon that people who live in tiny houses work from home. And if you don’t work from home, consider any crafts or skills you could offer. Just asking for money won’t do the trick. The key is to offer your services or crafts for various levels of donations. People will be more inclined to help out if they know it’s not just a handout!

**Get a low Interest credit card.** Although not the most recommended method of financing, an individual with good credit history might find success with the right terms.

## Which Method is Best for me?

The most popular way of financing a tiny house is through a loan provider; whether that means using a loan service that’s partnered with your tiny house builder, or acquiring a personal loan directly from a provider. Let’s take a closer look at the different types of loans you can get through these two options. 

## Loan Through Your Tiny House Builder

Tiny houses on wheels are often classified similarly to RVs (recreational vehicles) or campervans. If a tiny house on wheels is your ideal type of tiny, then an RV loan through a tiny house builder could be exactly what you’re looking for. In order to qualify for this type of loan, your tiny house must be certified by the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA). RVIA ensures that your tiny house on wheels meets specific safety requirements for life on the road. After doing some research on different[ tiny house builders](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-to-find-a-tiny-house-builder/), you’ll find that some are RVIA certified and some are not. Tiny house builders that are RVIA certified will often have a partnership agreement with a loan company to provide customers with a great option.

As mentioned in our previous article, [How to Find a Tiny House Builder](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-to-find-a-tiny-house-builder/), it's important to take the time to research exactly what you want. There are a number of key points to consider before choosing the right builder for your project. Here's a quick review of the questions you want to ask when deciding on the company that will build your dream tiny home:

* **How long have they been in business?** Go for a more experienced tiny house builder and you’re more likely to get someone who knows what works and what doesn’t.
* **Can they build exactly what I’m looking for?** While some tiny house builders focus on set designs, there are also builders out there who will take your dreams and make them a reality.
* **What kinds of material do they use?** Take a look at some of the tiny houses they built in the past. Make sure they use quality materials that will make your tiny house last.
* **Have they built a lot of tiny houses?** Tiny house builders often come from other types of building backgrounds, and may not know what’s what (even if they claim to). Make sure they’ve built other tiny houses before.

North Carolina is not the most tiny house friendly state. However, municipalities like Raleigh, Durham or Chapel Hill adjusted their regulations and could accept a tiny house. Make sure you discuss this with your tiny house builder before making the move, since they probably know the regulations or some interesting loopholes to exploit.

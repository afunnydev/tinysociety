As mentioned in our previous article, [How to Find a Tiny House Builder](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-to-find-a-tiny-house-builder/), not all tiny houses are created equal. And by that, we mean that there are some key points to consider before choosing the right builder for your project. Here’s a refresher on the most important points to consider:

* **How long have they been in business?** Go for a more experienced tiny house builder and you’re more likely to get someone who knows what works and what doesn’t.
* **Can they build exactly what I’m looking for?**While some tiny house builders focus on set designs, there are also builders out there who will take your design dreams and make them a reality!
* **What kinds of material do they use? **Take a look at some of the tiny houses they built in the past. Make sure they use quality materials that will make your tiny house last!
* **Have they built a lot of tiny houses?** Tiny house builders often come from other types of building backgrounds, and may not know what’s what (even if they claim to). Make sure they’ve built other tiny houses before.

California is an excellent [place to live in a tiny house](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-laws-united-states/). Known worldwide for its van-life culture, California is no stranger to the idea of living in small spaces. While most cities in California allow ADUs (accessory dwelling units), not all accept the idea of a tiny house on wheels. However, unlike other states, California is warming up to these mobile houses that aren’t quite RVs. Take Fresno for example. Fresno is the first city in the entire United States to allow tiny houses on wheels as secondary dwellings in residential neighborhoods--a massive win for the tiny house community. 

At the end of the day, the tiny house movement started out west and is slightly further along than its east coast counterparts. With an increasing number of tiny house builder choices, you’ll have your dream tiny home in no time (although you may need to ditch the California king-bed).

## Living Room/Dining Room

This space includes a bench with cushions for hanging out or watching television. A small two-seater breakfast bar faces a large window, and is a great spot for eating a meal or working on a laptop.

## Kitchen

A mere step away from the living room/dining room puts you in the center of the tiny home. The kitchen boasts an L-shaped counter with plenty of cabinets and surface areas for food prep.

## Bathroom

Our favorite part of the bathroom is the tub/shower combo. While a full-grown adult wouldn't be able to lie down in the tub, it certainly is a nice touch for anyone who loves baths or has kids.

## Bedroom

It isn't very often that you find a tiny house with a queen size bed on the ground floor. The separate bedroom has night stand storage, as well as a full-length closet.

What do you think about when you think of minimalism? Do you think about stark rooms with nothing in them? Or do you picture cold, sterile spaces void of color?

## What is a minimalist lifestyle?

**Cons:**

* **It can feel overwhelming.** While the main theme of minimalist generally is the same; how you define it for yourself can vary.The number of suggestions on the web about what minimalism is can be quite draining.

## **How do I start living a minimalist lifestyle?**

Your bedroom should be your personal oasis. However, in a tiny house, you’re likely working with a loft or other small space. This is where minimalism really comes in handy. Let’s start by looking at some useful tips for incorporating minimalism in your tiny house bedroom.

* **Don’t add too much color. **Use a neutral color palette of white or cream to give your tiny bedroom a clean, open look.
* **Don't put a lamp on the bedside table.** There wouldn’t be room for one anyway! Instead, hang string lights for some simple ambiance. 
* **Expose your clothes.** A [minimalist wardrobe](< https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-to-create-your-minimalist-wardrobe/>) is important here. Consider the metal bar from a rolling clothes rack or some narrow, exposed shelving for storing your staple clothing options. 
* **Use multi-purpose furniture. **A tiny house bedroom doesn’t have space for much; but a short, all white footstool can make the perfect bedside table.
* **Books for reading, books for art.** Old books can make a minimalist space look visually appealing, or be used as a low table.

Minimalism can also be extended into the space of the food we eat and the power we consume. Tiny house enthusiasts who are interested in wasting as little as possible, can continue reading to learn more about how minimalism can affect the way we look at food and power. 

## Minimalism and food.

Another aspect of life that can embrace minimalism, is food. Too much food today is over-processed or complicated. Additionally, far too many households buy too much food and end up wasting it. A great way to incorporate minimalism into the way you eat is by making your own food.

By making meals for the week from these fresh ingredients, you only need to buy exactly what you need. 

## Minimalism and power.

It’s true; waste tends to be unbecoming in the lifestyle of a minimalist. But waste occurs in terms of power everyday. Power is wasted when the lights are left on in a house with no one home. It’s also wasted when we leave our electronics plugged in overnight after they’re fully charged. Consider using alternative energy solutions like solar energy.

While minimalism is certainly compatible with tiny living, it’s also a great lifestyle for any size home. Remember, minimalism isn’t just about owning less. It’s about taking the steps to lead a more meaningful, happy life. While some may not understand the minimalist lifestyle, it’s important to keep in mind that minimalism isn’t so narrowly defined. Decide what minimalism means for you, and soon you’ll be living more with less!

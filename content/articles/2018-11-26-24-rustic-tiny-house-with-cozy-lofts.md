## Kitchen

Although small, this compact kitchen has everything one could need for food prep and cooking. What really makes this tiny kitchen stand out, is the attention to detail and the fact that it's tucked beneath a loft--truly a great use of space.

## Living Room

Not the largest of living rooms, but lovely nonetheless. The arm chair with tiny hobbit stove is a great touch. Another living room/den option is in the second loft.

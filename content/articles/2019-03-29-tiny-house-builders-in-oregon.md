As mentioned in our previous article, [How to Find a Tiny House Builder](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-to-find-a-tiny-house-builder/), not all tiny houses are created equal. And by that, we mean that there are some key points to consider before choosing the right builder for your project. Here’s a refresher on the most important points to consider:

* **How long have they been in business?** Go for a more experienced tiny house builder and you’re more likely to get someone who knows what works and what doesn’t.
* **Can they build exactly what I’m looking for?** While some tiny house builders focus on set designs, there are also builders out there who will take your design dreams and make them a reality!
* **What kinds of material do they use?** Take a look at some of the tiny houses they built in the past. Make sure they use quality materials that will make your tiny house last!
* **Have they built a lot of tiny houses?** Tiny house builders often come from other types of building backgrounds, and may not know what’s what (even if they claim to). Make sure they’ve built other tiny houses before.

Tiny houses are certainly not a new thing in Oregon. In fact, the tiny house lifestyle has been growing in popularity for quite awhile now! Living tiny in the state of Oregon is easier to do than in most states in the continental US. With a diverse landscape of forests, mountains and beaches, Oregon is truly a state that inspires living freely and in nature. Let’s take a look at some of the top tiny house builders that can help you make your tiny house dream, a reality.

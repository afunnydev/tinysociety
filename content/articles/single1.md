Roofing materials that are readily available from a local building supply source like Home Depot or Lowes can be used for your Tiny House, but you should consider how the house will be used and where it will be located. If you build a house in the Southern United States the options will most likely be different from what you would want to use in the far North. The differences will be most profound in the insulation that is used between the North and the South. Be sure to become familiar with the R-values of insulation types. Don’t shortcut the amount of insulation that is needed for the region that the home will be in. 

Some folks likely will want to use shingles on the roof of their Tiny House because of the styling and look. However, using shingles on a Tiny House could be a problem under the wrong circumstances. If the roof is a shallow pith such as a 2:12 pitch, it would be too shallow for shingles. Shingles are to be used on a roof that has a 4:12 or steeper pitch. It is because of the way the shingles seal down and the way they layer, anything less than a 4:12 pitch can cause the roof to leak. Not good for any roof. Another reason that shingles may not be the best choice is because they will see a lot of wind going down the road. Even Mobile Home builders have to deal with this problem when delivering a new Mobile home. I have seen a Mobile Home lose a shingle or two getting delivered. If you plan on moving your Tiny Home on a regular basis, shingles would not be the best choice.

> Shingles may not the best choice because they will see a lot of wind going down the road

By the way, the roof pitch such as a 2:12 is the amount the roof drops in a given foot. In this example, (2:12), it means that the roof pitches, or falls 2 inches for every foot that it reaches out from the ridge, or peak. If the Tiny Home was 8 feet wide, and the ridge ran down the length, each ‘half’ would be 4 feet wide. (Not counting the eve projection if there was one) So, a 2:12 pitch would have the outside edge of the roof, 8” lower than the ridge. Typically that would be the same for both halves, but it does not have to be so. This is a very basic explanation of a roof pitch. There are infinite ways a roof can be designed, and so it can get more complicated depending on the design. In a Tiny Home, the roof design becomes very important because it will effect the space inside the home, especially in the loft areas.

Thats enough of the heavy technicalities, now on to the material choices!

My roof material of choice is a metal roof and, it can be put on a shallow pitch. Using a shallow pitch on a Tiny Home can mean a pitch a low as 1:12. I used this type of design for a modern look that has no center ridge. In other words, the roof has a high side running down the length, and a lower side down the other length. If you use a 1:12 pitch on an 8 foot wide home, the Drivers side wall for instance would be 8 inches shorter than the Passenger side wall. This is a popular design, because it gives a lot of head room in the upper loft. It does mean that one side of the ceiling in the loft is taller than the other. I used that to my advantage when I would put my steps or the ladder on the side of the loft that was the highest. That makes it easier to access the loft for most people.

> Don’t take any shortcuts with fasteners

The one thing to remember when installing any roof material and when putting metal on a shallow pitch roof is this: You must always follow the roofing material manufacturers recommendations. They usually recommend a special sealing tape be sandwiched into the seams as it is installed while the metal roof is being put down with screws. Also, because of wind, the manufacturer will have a screw installation pattern recommendation that needs to be adhered to. This is even more important if your Tiny Home is going down the road at 60 mph. If you are driving into a headwind, the wind speed could even get worse, so don’t take any shortcuts with fasteners.

The other consideration when choosing a roof is color. If you are in the South, you should choose a lighter color because it will save a lot on air conditioning. If you are in the North, a darker roof will absorb sunlight and be warmer in the winter months.

Recreational Vehicles many times use a rubber sheeted roof. Unless you have experience with this material and have been trained on how to install it properly, I would not recommend it. 

I built one Tiny Home with a fiberglass roof and sealed it with a white elastomeric roof coating. That made a great roof, but a fiberglass roof is not something that you can get at a local building supply. It is a professional process, and the joints have to sealed with resin and fiberglass. 

All roofs have specific underlayment processes that are important. Be sure to ask enough questions when choosing the finished roof materials. A normal house has an attic space that can be ventilated. Tiny Homes do not usually have any air space in an attic that can be ventilated. So be sure to understand the special needs of a closed air space type construction. But that is why it is so important to buy a good set of plans from an architect…this way you get it right the first time!

The other advantage of getting a properly designed roof is weight distribution. An architect is highly trained to be sure that the load bearing characteristics of a roof design will serve the home and homeowner for years to come. A quality home is protected by a quality roof. This is vital if you are dealing with a snow load in your area of the country, so take time and plan with a professional. Its a fantastic adventure, enjoy the ride!

When designing or choosing your new Tiny Home, take the time to understand how the roof design effects the interior space and even the placement and sizing of doors and windows. If you want a more complex roof design that has extra peaks for aesthetics, you will use more material and you will have more complex joints to deal with such as a valley where two roof angles meet. Also, it is difficult to deal with on a small roof, but small gutters may be part of your plan to possibly collect rain water (if it is legal in your area), Rain gutters also can deflect water from running down over your front door or windows, and can also alleviate stains from appearing on the walls for dirt and particulate in the air. These are just a few of the topics we will be discussing soon.

Depending on how you design your roof, you may be able to plan for an additional roof to be added for a full length porch roof to be added at a later time. This would most likely be only done if the Tiny Home was installed at a stationary location no longer being moved around. Some folk use a Tiny Home for a vacation home near an attraction like a lake or in the mountains. In that case, you will be glad you planned for a porch roof.

In the case of a vacation home, a porch roof may also be an asset available to mount solar panels. Between the regular house roof and the porch roof, you will have plenty of extra square footage for a solar system for an off-grid home.

Should we talk about Skylights? Everybody wants them. They can be a great way to let the outdoor in and give a sense of openness to a small space. In a word, buy quality. You will love a good skylight, and you will hate a bad one. A good skylight can be poorly installed also, so be sure to seal it exactly as the manufacturer instructs. Any shortcuts here will cost you dearly at a later time. Usually a Skylight comes with a flange system that must be installed just so. An opening Skylight can be an extra way to access to roof for inspections. If you are the type that will be doing your own maintenance, that may be something that is attractive to you.

So what makes a roof leak? Anything that protrudes through the roof needs to be dealt with and installed properly. That would include any roof vents like the kind you see in an RV. These vents are great for getting the hot air out in a hurry. Any plumbing vents that go through the roof will also need a proper boot to prevent any roof leaks. Here is an example of a plumbing vent boot:

You may be getting the sense that a quality roof system is more that something to keep the rain off of your head. It is one of the most important systems in a home. Damage from a leaky roof can go unnoticed for years. Only to find out later that big damages have taken place. Sometime those damages may include replacing an entire wall. I had that problem one time so I know just how bad a leaky roof can get.

> Take care of your home and it will take care of you

You can avoid those types of problems by selecting a roof that will last for years. Always be sure that a roof is installed properly by someone with experience. As with any home, be sure to inspect it once a year if possible. Catching anything wrong right away is the best option. Take care of your home and it will take care of you.

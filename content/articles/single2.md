At first glance, the answer to the above question might seem obvious; after all, in a competition between a Tiny House and a full-size house, the Tiny is, well, tinier. It takes up less space on the planet and less resources, right? I’ll take a more in-depth look at the question and discover  whether the ‘obvious’ holds up in this case.

Let’s start with some definitions. Comparing a Tiny House to any full-size house is a different matter than comparing a Tiny House with, specifically, a full-size conventional stick-frame average-American-sized house. Any full-size house might, after all, be a large Earthship with composting toilets, a grey water system and solar panels to provide all of its energy needs. So for the sake of this comparison, I’ll be comparing Tiny Houses with the average American house.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median size of a new single-family house in 2016 was 2,422 square feet. It had air-conditioning, was wood-framed, was heated by gas or electricity, and was either connected to a public sewer or an individual septic system. A Tiny House, on the other hand, is typically less than 500 square feet. If it has air-conditioning at all, it’s generally in the form of a small window-box unit. Small space heaters are typical, whether fueled by electricity, propane, or even wood. Wood or metal framing is standard construction practice (on a metal frame trailer in the case of a mobile Tiny House on Wheels), and composting toilets of various levels of complexity are the norm.

Given this basis for comparison, let’s begin, with the understanding that I’m speaking in generalities here… there may of course be exceptions to any given point.

#### Construction

The Tiny House clearly requires less building materials and thus consumes fewer natural resources in its construction than the full-size house. It also requires less time with power tools (and therefore less electricity) to build (assuming a similar level of skill and experience on the part of the builders, of course). Less waste is created in the construction of a Tiny House than of a full-size house. Reclaimed and recycled materials may be used for either sized structure, but it’s a more common practice in Tiny House construction. First point awarded to the Tiny.

#### Earth Footprint

The Tiny House takes up less space on the planet. Oftentimes, in the case of Tiny Houses on Wheels, it does not require digging into the Earth for a foundation (and if it’s a Tiny House on Foundation, the foundation footprint is significantly smaller than that of a full-size house). From the point of view that digging up the planet is not environmentally friendly, this is another point in favor of the Tiny.

#### Plumbing

Tiny Houses are generally equipped with composting toilets. Assuming that the contents are safely returned to the earth, there is zero negative environmental impact and those who have studied such resources as The Humanure Handbook by Joseph C. Jenkins would argue that there is, in fact, a positive effect on the environment. The full-size house contributes to a sewer or a septic system, neither of which is good for the environment. The Tiny also often connects to an environmentally safe grey water system, while the full-size house places a further load on its sewer or septic system. Point 3 for the Tiny.

#### Mobility 

In the case of the Tiny House on Wheels, depending on the lifestyle of the owners, it may be moved quite frequently. There’s a carbon footprint expenditure to towing a house with a gasoline- or diesel-fueled truck, so I’ll offer a point to the full-size house, which generally stays put, unless you happen to be a girl from Kansas named Dorothy.

#### Electricity

And electricity? It takes fewer light fixtures to light a smaller space. Home appliances are generally smaller and less energy-consumptive to fit the scale of a Tiny House than those used in a full-size house. Tiny House residents tend to spend more time outdoors than full-size house residents, in order to avoid cabin fever, so there’s even less consumption of power as a result. Of course, either the Tiny or the full-size house can take advantage of alternative energy sources such as solar panels, so this point could be considered a draw, unless one wishes to split hairs and point to the fact that fewer materials go into the manufacture of the number of solar panels and their associated storage batteries needed to supply a Tiny House versus those necessary to power a full-sized house. The Tiny gains another point.

#### Heating & Cooling

Whether accomplished by electricity, propane, gas, or wood, it requires less fuel to heat a small space than it does a large one. That goes for air conditioning too. Again, alternative energy sources have the potential to even the playing field on this one, but otherwise, point goes to the Tiny.

#### Water Consumption 

Water usage depends on the residents. Even with a smaller wardrobe (the result of a smaller closet), a Tiny House dweller may do just as much laundry as a full-sized house dweller, but will likely be washing many of the same items with each load. Many Tiny dwellers line-dry their laundry, but this is just as easily done by the residents of a full-size house. Washing dishes, bathing or showering, even gardening, all contribute to water usage that varies from person to person or family to family, regardless of the size of their home. No points awarded.

#### Consumerism 

The Tiny House limits the quantity of belongings a person or a family can own. There’s simply not enough space to store a lot of “stuff,” and so the Tiny dweller must carefully consider each purchase. This is certainly an option for the full-size house dweller as well, but not a requirement. Sure, a Tiny dweller could shop to his heart’s content and fill up storage unit after storage unit, but doing so is not in keeping with the Tiny philosophy, which the bulk of Tiny dwellers adopt upon embarking on that lifestyle, nor is it a practical reality for those who relocate often. This isn’t a strong enough point to be awarded to either side since a full-size house dweller may choose to limit her consumerism as fully as a Tiny House dweller must.

#### Maintenance 

This may be a lesser issue, but even cleaning supplies—whether the residents choose environmentally friendly options or not—have less impact for use in a small space than in a larger one. And it requires less paint, sealant, and coatings to restore and maintain a Tiny House than it does a full-size house. The Tiny House increases its lead by a point.

#### Conclusion 

Unless I’m missing something major, it seems we have a clear winner in an environmental friendliness competition between Tiny Houses and full-sized houses. While there are many reasons why someone might decide to embark on the Tiny lifestyle  (as well as many reasons why someone might choose not to), if environmentalism is a priority in your life, a Tiny House could certainly be one way to embody that philosophy, in a rather “big” way.

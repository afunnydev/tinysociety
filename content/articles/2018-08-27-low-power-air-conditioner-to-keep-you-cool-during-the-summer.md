While summertime brings some of the best weather of the entire year, it also brings some of the most uncomfortable days, too. I love almost everything about summer; ice-cold drinks with friends, the suntanned skin, and especially the long beach days. But one thing that I don’t love is the sticky, humidity that often comes with it. Just because the hot sun feels wonderful at the beach, doesn’t mean we want that when we come home. There’s no better feeling than bursting through the front door after a scorching day out, and feeling like you’ve entered the North Pole. Let’s take a look at some air conditioners so you’re prepared to handle the heat next summer. 

## What are the different types of air conditioners?

1. **Central Air Conditioning**

The most common type of air conditioning out there. This system works best with larger homes, and can be extremely efficient if sized correctly.

\    2. **Window Air Conditioner**

This compact unit is also fairly common in households where you want to cool one, specific room. 

\    3. **Mini Split**

This ductless unit is also great for cooling individual rooms (or tiny houses).

\    4. **Portable Air Conditioner**

Often considered the “next generation of window units,” these efficient and affordable air conditioners are also designed to cool one room.

\    5. **Hybrid Air Conditioners**

Uses alternative energy (electric pump and fossil fuels) to heat or cool your home. Check out [this article ](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-to-power-tiny-house-with-solar-energy/)if you’re interested in learning more about how alternative energy like solar power can work in your tiny house.

\    6. **Geothermal Cooling**

Although highly sustainable, this unit is tricky to install and fairly expensive. A series of geothermal coils are buried in the ground beneath your home to extract heat and create cooler temperatures. 

## Which Air Conditioning Systems are Best for a Tiny House?

The most highly recommended air conditioning systems for tiny houses are window units, portable units, and mini splits. Window units are not only affordable, but they can also be easily installed into a tiny house window with little to no hassle. Portable units are a great choice because they are also inexpensive and can cool a tiny home efficiently. On the other hand, mini split air conditioners look good, and can be mounted anywhere with a series of ductwork that runs through your tiny house. Mini splits may be more aesthetically pleasing, but window units and portable units are cheaper. Each of these air conditioning units have energy efficient options to choose from. 

_**Something to Note:**_

BTU (British Thermal Unit), is a unit of energy that tells you how much heat is needed to raise one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. When purchasing a cooling unit, it’s a good idea to use this [BTU calculator](https://www.calculator.net/btu-calculator.html) to make sure the system you are buying is compatible with your tiny house. 

## Recommendation #1: [Frigidaire Mini-Compact Window Air Conditioner](https://www.totalhomesupply.com/frigidaire-ffre1033u1-10-000-btu-window-unit-room-air-conditioner-energy-star/p/frigidaire-ffre1033u1)

This 10,000 BTU Energy-Star window unit uses standard electricity, and effectively cools a space of up to 450 square feet. Installation is extremely simple, and the unit can be set on a timer so you can cool your home at a time that best suits your schedule. 

## Recommendation #2: [Oasis Mini-Split](https://www.compactappliance.com/mrcool-mini-split-air-conditioners/O-ES-24-HP-230.html)

[Source: Compact Appliance](https://www.compactappliance.com/mrcool-mini-split-air-conditioners/O-ES-24-HP-230.html)

This sleek, compact unit is Energy-Star certified, and has a cooling capacity of 24,000 BTUs. At a higher price than a window unit, this air conditioner will cool a tiny house quickly and efficiently. Installation should be done by a professional, as it’s necessary to run piping through the walls. This is an extremely popular choice amongst tiny house enthusiasts because it is typically installed up high, and out of the way.

## Recommendation #3: [Whirlpool Portable Air Conditioner](https://www.compactappliance.com/whirlpool-portable-air-conditioners/WHAP122AW.html)

Another Energy-Star certified unit, this portable air conditioner provides 12,000 BTUs of chilly air. With a 24-hour programmable timer, this unit can work around the clock and on your schedule. Although modern looking, this unit does take up a minimal amount of floor space. It’s a good idea to have someplace to store it when it’s not in use!

## Other Cooling Options

1. [**Fan**](https://www.wayfair.com/home-improvement/pdp/stadler-form-otto-14-floor-fan-szy1002.html?domain=bestproducts.com&SSAID=314743&SSAID=314743&refid=SS314743&creative=65867&m=11035)

![](/img/screen-shot-2018-08-27-at-12.05.14.png)

A low-tech, classic form of staying cool. Although on exceptionally hot days, it can sometimes feel like a regular-old fan isn’t doing the job. Luckily, there are a variety of electric cooling fans on the market that will do more than just blow hot air around.

2. [**KoolerAire**](http://www.kooleraire.com/)

![](/img/air-conditioner-cooler.gif)

This battery-powered cooler box blows air through ice, effectively sending a shot of continuous, cold air out of a vent. At only $40 USD, this unit can run up to 27 hours between charges and cool off your small space for a small price!

I’m a big fan of staying cool in a tiny house. Be sure to speak with a professional to help you decide which unit will provide you with the most efficient cooling option.

There are about 10,000 tiny houses in the US alone, with northeastern states like Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire leading the tiny real estate rush. 

What surprises me, though, is that an average tiny house owner is 50% more likely to stand better financially than a traditional suburban house owner.

We can attribute part of this money-savvy to making intelligent choices in all areas down to furnishing a home. 

You can’t afford to go overboard when it comes to tiny house decor.

Less is more in this case, but you need to make every purchase count. 

To help you make the right choices, we bring you ten tiny house accessories that won't break the bank. 

## Top tiny house accessories

### Foldable storage

Living in a miniature house means that storage space is the most expensive commodity. Indeed, you can fit some of your things inside your [tiny house furniture](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-furniture/) with hidden storage, but not everything. You need foldable storage solutions to dump all your miscellaneous stuff without worrying about the mess.

![foldable storage](/img/foldable-storage.jpg)

Storage boxes are the way to go here, and even better if they look nice and can be folded down for storage when not in use.

These [foldable baskets made from water hyacinth](https://www.amazon.com/Trademark-Innovations-Foldable-Hyacinth-Storage/dp/B0147CB0O6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1EVMSCM61I37V&keywords=water+hyacinth+storage+foldable&qid=1677515397&sprefix=water+hyacinth+storage+foldable%2Caps%2C193&sr=8-3) are perfect for open shelving and will zhuzh up any tiny apartment decor.   

### Collapsible containers

Open the container cupboard, and half of the mess spills on the floor.  We've all experienced this anxiety, but in tiny homes, you can't even afford to have that mess. 

![collapsible container](/img/collapsible-containers.jpg)

These collapsible [lunch boxes from Rubbermaid](https://www.amazon.com/Rubbermaid-2108389-Brilliance-44-Piece-Container/dp/B07X64Z8RM/ref=sr_1_21_sspa?crid=3E9KS0WYUXBYL&keywords=wakatobi%2Bcontainers&qid=1677515279&sprefix=wakatobi%2Bcontainers%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-21-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFUFQ5Mk8xQU5MMlUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA4MjIxMTgxNzI5TVNXRjU5OFlBJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5MjM2NDgzREhPU0I2Q09ROEFNJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1) are a perfect space-saving solution for [tiny house kitchens](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/eesentials-things-to-have-in-a-tiny-house-kitchen/). You can fold them in on themselves, so they don't take up lots of extra space. On top of it,  they are dishwasher, microwave, oven, and freezer safe. 

Take them on a picnic or pack the next day's lunch and they fit easily in your bag when you're done. 

Psst, you can bring them to restaurants, too, so you don't need to use those single-use takeaway containers you'd throw in the garbage the same day. Sustainability all along. 

### Deck chair

If you're buying a tiny house but don't like the outdoors, do yourself a service and give up while you can. Most tiny house owners spend a lot of time outside and they're enjoying it. Seriously, the raised deck and the flat roof are a big part of tiny living. I wouldn't change a cup of morning coffee on my tiny house deck for anything in the world. 

![deck chairs](/img/deck-chairs.jpg)

These classic design [collapsible deck chairs](https://www.amazon.com/PURPLE-LEAF-Portable-Folding-Outdoor/dp/B09KBWS7G1/ref=sr_1_17_sspa?crid=1BQ0LLN7ZFDN4&keywords=deck+chair&qid=1677515007&sprefix=deck+chair%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-17-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyMjJKN0FYWFJOTzNWJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTY0MjMyMTJKUVFaN1lRUjdVTiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDk0NDU1MTU5U0RGNUo5WVlaWCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) from Purple Leaf are the best way to do this. This is a piece of furniture you can even pack in the car for a trip to the beach or store inside your house on wheels the next time you move location. They come in a range of colors, from vivid turquoise to striped gray and lotus root khaki. My choice? Classic linen.  

### Multi-layered coat hangers

While we often talk about the unfathomable benefits of tiny living, we tend to forget some of the downsides. There's no other way to put it, but downsizing your living space also means reducing your wardrobe. 

![multi layered coat hangers](/img/multil-layered-coat-hangers.jpg)

In other words, you need to part with some of your clothes. 

In my case, these [multi-layered magic coat hangers](https://www.amazon.com/AMKUFO-Hangers-Organizer-Plastic-Clothes/dp/B082K8XTBS/ref=sr_1_4?crid=24PZ13RALMJN8&keywords=multi+layered+coat+hangers&qid=1677514716&s=home-garden&sprefix=multilayered+coat+hangers%2Cgarden%2C186&sr=1-4) were lifesavers. You can hang your multiple clothes vertically and save a fantastic amount of closet space. One kit allows you to hang up to 60 garments.

Hey, but I downsized my wardrobe. Or did I?

### Pegboard storage

I've always felt that pegboard storage doesn't receive enough praise. While you can regularly find one in garages and DIY workshops, they are also ideal for hanging oddly shaped items like kitchen utensils, pots, and pans.

![pegboard storage](/img/pegboard.jpg)

Apart from using them to maximize the wall space storage, you can use them inside the cupboards but also as organizers in your drawers.  

The best thing about these vertical space savers is that once the layout doesn't work for you anymore, all you need to do is rearrange the pegs, and you're good to go. 

If you have some tools and a sheet of plywood, you can make a pegboard yourself. 

If not, this [JoyBHole Pegboard Kit](https://www.amazon.com/JoyBHole-Pegboard-Combination-Accessories-Organizer/dp/B0924BD9QQ/ref=sr_1_20?crid=GJYKJR56TIEM&keywords=pegboard%2Bstorage&qid=1677514477&s=home-garden&sprefix=pegboard%2Bstorage%2Cgarden%2C210&sr=1-20&th=1) comes with bin hooks, brackets, and everything you need for easy storage and customization. Each of these six 11” pegboards can support a load of 11 lbs.  

### Fairy lights

Fairy lights? Really? You people must be running out of ideas. What's next? Garden gnome speakers?

Think again.

![fairy lights](/img/fairy-lights.jpg)

Tiny houses have limited floor space, and walls are usually dedicated to some kind of storage or dominated by large window panes to allow you to enjoy the view. 

This means you have few options when it comes to ambiance mood lighting. Lamps are bulky and take up lots of space. 

Fairy lights, on the other hand, you can weave through banisters to your loft space or around the ceiling of your dining space, where they take up effectively zero space. 

You can get ones that run on batteries or [fairy lights that run on solar power](https://www.amazon.com/BOLWEO-Waterproof-Christmas-Halloween-Decoration/dp/B07RBK3TYS/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2OS3JWWJWIHQ9&keywords=solar+powered+indoor+fairy+lights&qid=1677515489&sprefix=solar+powered+indoor+fairy+lights%2Caps%2C211&sr=8-2). These solar-powered fairy lights are safe outdoors and look just as great on your patio. In either case, fairy lights are a budget solution that will make an impression on every visitor. 

### Cable management box

In a limited space, power cords are much easier to notice and become a tangled cluster of snakes. Apart from being an eyesore, they can easily pose a tripping hazard. 

![cable management box](/img/cable-management-box.jpg)

A simple cable management box can help you hide your power cords with slots where your cords can come out as they are needed. 

When you don't need them, you can neatly wrap the cables and hide them in the box.

This [cable management box from Teyga](https://www.amazon.com/TEYGA-Bamboo-Cable-Management-Box/dp/B0782YJ4DV/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2VCQWHEMQZH5A&keywords=cable%2Bmanagement%2Bbox&qid=1677510669&sprefix=cable%2Bmanagement%2Bbox%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWU41RkZEOVVON1NEJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTE1MjI2MzVXNDI3Qk1ZTzJQNiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTU2NTAwMUZMTVNVN1oyV1hPRCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1) is made of bamboo and will blend in any tiny apartment space. It comes with a magnetic lid, so it's both kid and pet friendly. 

### Foldable stool

When you have extra guests, you can easily run out of seating. That is unless you get a couple of [foldable stools](https://www.amazon.com/Folding-Foldable-Inches-Weight-Capacity/dp/B09TKTJ9XG/ref=sr_1_3?crid=K4ZRWZ4LRUG5&keywords=foldable%2Bpaper%2Bstool&qid=1677510337&sprefix=foldable%2Bpaper%2Bstool%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-3&th=1). These beautiful designs can be folded to a depth of only 3 cm for easy storage.

![foldable stool](/img/foldable-stool.jpg)

That's no thicker than a single book on your shelf, so you don't need much space for storage.

They are made with folded-up recycled kraft paper that can hold up to 200 kg when rounded into a stool. 

The paper folds have powerful magnets on each side to keep the chair propped up securely. 

These foldable stools come in 8 bright colors and are the perfect solution for tiny homes that need a drop of flush. 

### Hammock

The inside of your home may feel a bit cramped from time to time, but the outdoor space definitely isn't. 

![hammock](/img/hammock.jpg)

Whether you have a deck or just some trees to tie it to, a comfortable hammock can offer you a whole new spot to chill. 

Spruce up your outdoor living space with [this macrame hammock](https://www.amazon.com/SXSEAGLE-Hammock-Hanging-Macrame-Outdoor/dp/B09J27ZHVG/ref=sxin_16_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.17640126-9148-4700-a727-578cd66ffa9f%3Aamzn1.sym.17640126-9148-4700-a727-578cd66ffa9f&crid=36VP9HIVYGPVD&cv_ct_cx=hammock&keywords=hammock&pd_rd_i=B09J27ZHVG&pd_rd_r=5f7f5347-a852-43b4-940a-05b46ac492fc&pd_rd_w=y4OP4&pd_rd_wg=Pfj1H&pf_rd_p=17640126-9148-4700-a727-578cd66ffa9f&pf_rd_r=2V7WD4SRA4993T5772XV&qid=1677512219&sprefix=hammock%2Caps%2C190&sr=1-3-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQjYxUjZPWTlLVTNLJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzM1MTM4MTNCNzhaMDdHNDIzUyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTg4NDE1TlNISVRIVkVUU1g4JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1) made of strong cotton and soft linen rope. 

It's strong enough to hold two people, while the crocheted tassels hanging from both sides will add elegance to your camper decor. 

### Air purifier

Finally, let's address the 2.5 μm elephant in the room. Tiny houses are comfy, but you'll soon realize that dust accumulates much faster in a small space than in a traditional home. 

![air purifier](/img/air-purifier.jpg)

Opening doors and windows can help with the ventilation, but that also lets outside particles like allergens inside. 

Also, not every tiny house is on a mountainous overlook surrounded by a 100-year-old forest. 

Owners are regularly setting up their tiny houses in the midst of urban congestion, even on tops of buildings, so opening windows won't do any good.

This [air purifier from Xiaomi](https://www.amazon.com/Purifier-3-Layer-Integrated-Cylindrical-Filters/dp/B07ZV7BDXZ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=335BXI09UWMQG&keywords=air+purifier+xiaomi&qid=1677513270&s=home-garden&sprefix=air+purifier+xiaomi%2Cgarden%2C199&sr=1-4) comes with a 3-layer HEPA filter. It will eliminate 99% of dust, pollen, and pet fur and maintain the quality of your indoor air. 

It connects to your home via Wi-Fi and allows you to monitor the air quality on the mobile app. 

## Wrapping up

When I was moving into a tiny house, culling my belongings was the most exciting part. Always remember that with every bag of clutter that you leave behind, you get something much more valuable in return:

A decluttered mind, unfettered by countless possessions than only a tiny multipurpose living space can bring. 

Keep the real value and use these tiny house accessories ideas to keep it all neat and at hand.

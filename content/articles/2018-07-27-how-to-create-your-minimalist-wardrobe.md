Who wants a closet full of clothes they don’t wear? Downsizing in square footage means there is simply no room for unnecessary clothing items that you haven’t seen since the dark ages. Creating a minimalist capsule wardrobe is more than just a trendy thing to do, it’s a necessity when it comes to living in a tiny house. Sure, it’s a daunting task to go through a mountain of clothes, but I can guarantee that you will feel a lot lighter once you’ve shed all of those layers! 

Let’s take a closer look at the first steps for creating your minimalist wardrobe. 

## Wear the things you 100% love.

It helps to understand what kind of style you have first in order to narrow down your wardrobe. Your personal style is about _you_ and the pieces that _you_ like. No one said you needed to be super fashionable! Whether you are into sportswear or looking to be on trend with millennial digital nomads, your style is whatever you make of it. Getting a touch more specific about the kinds of clothes you like to wear will make the process a whole lot easier!

## Quality vs Quantity.

Build your wardrobe the way you would build your tiny house by investing in quality, lasting materials. Owning fewer pieces of clothing that are of higher quality is always smart. Spending a little more on a jacket that will last you a long time is better than owning a bunch of cheaply made ones. In the case of quality versus quantity, investing in pieces that don’t need replacing each year is ideal, particularly if you live far from shopping malls!

## Give away, keep, toss.

For some, this is the hardest part. It’s easy to want to hold onto clothes that bring back memories, but dividing your clothes into these three categories will help you pave the path to success. Do I wear that shirt often? Keep. I don’t wear this jacket anymore, but it’s in good condition. Donate. Where did this stained, moth-eaten sweater come from? Definitely toss. Knowing when to hold on and when to let go is a real skill. One that you can definitely master, given the right mindset! 

_Pro Tip:_ If you haven’t worn it in the past month, you don’t need it. This might seem a little harsh, but doing so will fast-track you toward your goal.

## The Essentials.

Basic doesn’t necessarily mean boring! Finding clothing pieces in colors like grey, black and white can be more easily mixed and matched than clothing with eye-catching patterns. If you’re looking to stand out a bit, choose quality accent items like a scarf or durable flannel shirt to wear with your plain top. This way, you are able to have both style and function in your wardrobe!

Do I live in a primarily cold climate? Is it hot nine months out of the year? The temperature and climate of where you live in your tiny house are important factors to consider when choosing the essentials for your minimalist wardrobe. Pick your clothing pieces based on what types of outfits you will wear the most, not the least!

Still not sure where to begin? Here is a great list of basics to get your minimalist wardrobe started:

* 4 comfortable tops
* 2 “nicer” tops
* 1 light, button up shirt
* 3 pants
* 2 shorts
* 1-2 “going out” outfits
* Sleepwear
* Exercise wear
* 7 pairs of underwear
* 3 bras
* 7 pairs of socks
* Swimwear
* 2 sweaters or sweatshirts
* 1 outerwear jacket
* 1 set hat, gloves, scarf

## The Takeaway.

Hopefully now you feel inspired to let go of some of the pieces that clutter your tiny home and your closet space. Understanding your style, dividing your clothes into piles, sticking to the essentials, and buying quality pieces are all great steps to take in creating a minimalist wardrobe. 

Keep in mind that there are many other factors that can affect the clothing you choose. For instance, if you like to exercise a lot, adding more athletic clothes might be the staple in your wardrobe. Also, remember that climate and seasons play a big role in the types of clothes you own. Above all, it’s important to own clothes that you like; otherwise you may not wear them at all! 

Hopefully, these tips will help you cut down on unnecessary items that take up too much of your precious storage space. In reality, there are far more interesting things to do when living in a tiny house than to worry about what to wear every day!

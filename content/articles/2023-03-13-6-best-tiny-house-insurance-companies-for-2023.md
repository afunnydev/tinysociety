## FAQs

What is tiny house insurance?

Tiny house insurance is property insurance that provides coverage for damage to mobile homes and RVs. The type of insurance you'll choose for your tiny home depends on how it's built. Mobile home insurance covers a stationary tiny home that is built on a permanent foundation, while RV insurance covers a tiny home built on a trailer.

How much does tiny house insurance cost?

Tiny house insurance costs depend on different factors. For example, mobile home insurance from American Family Insurance costs $1,239 per year, for a 200-square-foot tiny home with $100,000 in dwelling coverage. 

What types of tiny homes can be insured?

Any type of tiny home can be insured, but it's easier to get coverage if your tiny house is certified. You can get a certification at The National Organization of Alternative Housing (NOAH), which certifies stationary homes, and the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA), which certifies tiny homes on wheels. 

What is the maximum tiny house size that is insurable?

The maximum insurable tiny house size is 600 square feet. 

## Final verdict

While there are many tiny house insurers, you should always pay attention to companies that have great customer service, additional endorsements, and coverage bundling. 

For houses on wheels, the best option is Foremost, which also offers policies for sporting gear and other RV accessories.

If you're building a tiny home yourself, The Hartford provides coverage for builder's risk, material theft, and vandalism.

The best all-around company is Strategic Insurance Agency. It gives you the most important coverages for permanent dwellings as well as endorsements for additional protection.

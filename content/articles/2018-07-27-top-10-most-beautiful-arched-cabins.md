This is the perfect demonstration of an open floor plan I was talking about earlier. The Tiny arched cabin can be used for various purposes and may well be home for your kids. 

The design allows you to customize and use the home in whatever way you like. Restroom and kids play are two options I can see.

This is the simplest tiny kit cabin which you can ever see but surely would make a good tiny home. 

If you are planning to build it on an open ground then you might use it as your restroom. You can also remove some of the clutter from your home and use this as an additional shelter. 

Choices are yours! 

What caught my eyes is the space for keeping your bicycle or even motorcycle in this arched cabin! Brilliant isn’t it?

If you are planning to build a cost effective home for living I bet you will not find a home like this.

It is a double storied arched cabin that will provide you with proper ventilation and breathing environment. There is a balcony in the second floor and moveable windows to protect you from rain.

This is one of most memorable Arched cabins I have seen!

The ground floor has been left open which can be used as a shelter for goods and animals to keep them safe from rain and sunlight. The upper two floors are beautifully designed from externally. 

Just imagine the view at night you are going to experience from this house. 

Ok that one is not so tiny, but I had to put it in the top 10!

This arched cabin I found on Pinterest is a perfect example to build on a corner of your lawn.

The sitting benches outside the home is where you want to be during the evening.

Though it’s nothing fancy but I loved the thought of seeing the falling sun together with my family in those benches. Simple but yet attractive! What do you think?

## Tiny House - 9

Number 9 on the list is an arched cabin from Southern Missouri.

This arched cabin might not look strong enough as it is built on a wooden stand. But the truth is it's not only strongly built but its overall design and look has surprised quite a lot of people in the neighborhood.

The home is double storied and in addition to that the balconies further enhance the beauty of it. 

## Tiny House - 10

Don’t underestimate this tiny home seeing that it’s the last on the list. I have seen many tiny homes but this one really captured my thoughts.

This arched cabin costs about $10000 on ebay which might be quite a lot compared to other arched cabins in this list. But it can be used as an exclusive space for garden office, camping or business office.

You can take inspiration from this design and build your own saving more money. But you will hardly find any tiny home with such glamour.

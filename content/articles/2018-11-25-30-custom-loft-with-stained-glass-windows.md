## Kitchen

Full-sized kitchen appliance and plentiful cabinet space make this tiny house kitchen anything but tiny. There are also a number of counter tops--perfect for cooking and food prep! An available option is the Furrion propane oven and cooktop which is certified for RV use.

## Living Room

The living room is the first space you enter when you walk into the tiny home. The small corner couch has storage underneath and beautiful window views.

## Bathroom

Just beyond the kitchen is the tiny house bathroom. Although small, it has everything you need. There's even a nook for laundry facilities.

## Sleeping Spaces

A set of custom stairs leads to a spacious sleeping loft. There's even enough room for some custom shelving for clothes. An additional sleeping space can be made out of the sofa on the main floor.

  title: What Are the Challenges of Living in a Tiny House with a Family?
  description: >
    A Tiny House can feel quite spacious for a single occupant, but what is it
    like when you’re sharing 200 square feet with three or four other people…
    plus maybe a few furry, four-legged family members? Even if you’re just two
    people now, perhaps you have plans to have a family and are wondering
    whether that’s possible in a Tiny House.

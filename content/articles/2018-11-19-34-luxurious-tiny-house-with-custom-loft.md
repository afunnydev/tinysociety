## Kitchen

Equipped with top of the line appliances, the kitchen feels anything but tiny. Full size appliances and spacious counter tops mean you have plenty of room to cook up a big meal.

## Living Room

Next to the breakfast bar is the airy living room. Big enough for a comfy set of couches, this open plan area makes an excellent place for entertaining.

## Bathroom

This tiny house bathroom is large enough for a walk-in shower, composting toilet, and sink. Our favorite part about the bathroom is that it's conveniently located between the bedroom and living space!

## Sleeping Spaces

Just beyond the bathroom is the master bedroom with a custom Murphy Bed/workspace combo. A ladder leads up to the loft which can either be a second cozy sleeping space or storage area.

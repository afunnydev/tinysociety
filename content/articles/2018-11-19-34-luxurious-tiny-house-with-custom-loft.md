## Kitchen

Equipped with top of the line appliances, this tiny house kitchen is anything but tiny. Full size appliances and spacious counter tops mean you have plenty of room to cook up a big meal.

## Living Room

Just next to the breakfast bar is the living room. Big enough for a comfy set of couches, this open plan area makes an excellent room for entertaining.

## Bathroom

This tiny house bathroom is large enough for a big shower, composting toilet, and sink. Our favorite part about the bathroom is that it's conveniently between the bedroom and living space!

## Sleeping Spaces

Just beyond the bathroom is the master bedroom with a custom Murphy Bed/workspace combo. A ladder leads up to the loft which can either be a cozy sleeping space, or storage area.

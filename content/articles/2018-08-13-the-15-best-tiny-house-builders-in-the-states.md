As houses, cars, and everything else appears to have “super-sized” over the years, many people are beginning to look for a simpler answer. Tiny houses are more in demand than ever, and seem to tick all of the boxes of those looking to downsize and simplify their lives. Usually 500 square feet or less, tiny houses focus on quality over quantity. But how does one get a high-quality tiny house? A great way to begin is by finding a tiny house builder who can help you kickstart what’s bound to be an exciting adventure! 

## What Can A Tiny House Builder Help Me With?

Tiny house builders will help you with everything from the design process to the actual building of the house. Fortunately, this is the golden age for tiny houses, and almost every builder is going to come from a small-medium sized company that still gets super excited about these little guys. But how can you be sure you have a good tiny house builder? Here are some good points to consider:

* How long have they been in business? Go for a more experienced tiny house builder and you’re more likely to get someone who knows what works and what doesn’t.
* Can they build exactly what I’m looking for? While some tiny house builders focus on set designs, there are also builders out there who will take your design dreams and make them a reality!
* What kinds of material do they use? Take a look at some of the tiny houses they built in the past. Make sure they use quality materials that will make your tiny house last!
* Have they built a lot of tiny houses? Tiny house builders often come from other types of building backgrounds, and may not know what’s what (even if they claim to). Make sure they’ve built other tiny houses before.

Now that you know some of the things to look for when choosing a tiny house builder, let’s take a look at some of the best (and best quality) tiny house builders in the U.S.

title: Tiny House on wheels or stationnary ?
description: >
  Whether or not to choose a Tiny House on wheels or a stationary Tiny House on
  foundation is as likely to be a matter of personal circumstances as it is
  personal preference. If you have long-term access to a piece of property, then
  you have the choice of either option. Otherwise, you’re probably looking at a
  Tiny House on wheels.

    Ah, the eternal question. It’s right up there with “To be or not to be,” or
    “Should I stay or should I go?” Okay, maybe not, but it IS one of the first
    decisions to make when embarking upon the Tiny House life.

    Whether or not to choose a Tiny House on wheels or a stationary Tiny House
    on foundation is as likely to be a matter of personal circumstances as it is
    personal preference.

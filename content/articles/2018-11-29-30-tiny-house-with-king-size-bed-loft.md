## Kitchen

The kitchen area runs along one side of the tiny house and has custom cabinets and stainless-steel appliances. A beautiful vent hood from Italy adds the perfect finishing touch.

## Sleeping Spaces

A loft space accessible by a custom storage staircase is large enough to fit a king bed. If you don't like the idea of climbing into a loft, you can also have a bedroom on the ground floor.

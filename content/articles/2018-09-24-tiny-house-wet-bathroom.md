There are plenty of ideas out there for saving space in a tiny house bathroom, but none does this quite as well as the wet bathroom. Just as the name implies, a tiny house is...well, tiny. It would only make sense that a tiny house bathroom would be proportionally compact. Remember, a bathroom typically needs a sink, toilet, and place to bathe or shower. If you consider the amount of utility that needs to be packed into such a small space, you’ll start thinking about the best ways to combine function with design. 

## How does it work?

Essentially, a wet bathroom turns your entire bathroom into shower space when in use. The shower floor shares the space with where you use the toilet and where you wash your hands. Often, the shower head is detachable to make washing easier. While you could stand and shower in the middle of the bathroom, you can also use the toilet seat as a shower seat. A tiny house bathroom is all about multi-functional spaces!

## Something to keep in mind…

Deciding on a wet bathroom also means you’ll have to do some serious moisture control. The reality is that the entire room will be wet. It’s important to take steps the ensure your tiny house bathroom (and your tiny house) is able to combat mold! A stylish way to waterproof your tiny bathroom is by installing tiles throughout the entire space. Just remember--tiles can be fairly heavy! 

_**Pro Tip: **_Another thing to keep in mind is that you’ll need a place to keep your toilet paper from getting wet. A plastic, water-tight box or something similar should do the trick.

## Do I need to have a wet bathroom?

Not at all! A wet bathroom isn’t the only option for a tiny house bathroom.

There’s no rule that even says a tiny house must have running water. Whether you want to have a tiny tub, a wet bathroom, or nothing at all--how you wash (or if you don’t) is up to you.

## Why we love wet bathrooms.

* They’re easy to clean. You don’t have to worry about making a mess when all it takes is a quick spray of the shower head to clean. 
* They’re accessible. For anyone who has restricted mobility, a wet bathroom is a safe option as there are no steps or edges involved. 
* They increase your tiny house value. Substantial waterproofing is necessary in order to have a wet bathroom. You’re increasing your tiny home’s value because tiny houses are extremely susceptible to unwanted moisture and mold. 
* They save space! Most showers and bathtubs require a dedicated space--a wet bathroom does not! 

## The Takeaway

A wet bathroom is a great solution not only for tiny houses, but for any small space. Wet bathrooms are also highly compatible with small apartments, RVs, and even trains. They allow tiny homeowners to downsize without having to sacrifice on the comforts of a regular bathroom.

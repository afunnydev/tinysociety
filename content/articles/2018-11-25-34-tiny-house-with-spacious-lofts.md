This custom 289 square foot tiny boasts a large kitchen, bathroom, living room, and two huge lofts. This is the perfect tiny house on wheels for a multi-person family interested in full-time tiny living, or the ultimate vacation home.

## Kitchen

The L-shape of the kitchen area makes it feel spacious and open-plan. The smaller stove top also leaves more room for food prep on the counters. A full-sized fridge fits neatly next to the counter.

## Living Room

The living room is situated between the bathroom and the kitchen. It's spacious enough for a sofa and whatever else you might need!

## Bathroom

Our favorite part of the bathroom is the tiny tub! While an adult couldn't fully submerge themselves, it's an excellent option for bath time with kids. A small laundry room just beyond the bathroom could double as a ground floor bedroom if needed.

Building a tiny house from scratch takes time and patience. Unless you’re a professional contractor, the planning process alone can quickly become overwhelming. It’s for this reason that many people who are interested in this lifestyle choose to start with a tiny house kit. You still get the hands-on experience of building your own home, but the kit comes with everything you need. Well, almost everything. 

From pre-cut materials to the very last screw, this option will ensure you don’t have that dreaded moment where you realize you’ve forgotten something essential like to leave room for your front door to open. Here’s a look at everything you need to know to help you with your decision as well as some of the best tiny house kits on the market today. 

## Things to Know Before Building a Tiny House Using a Kit

While the price tag on most tiny house kits can be appealing, there is no standardization in regards to what you’ll be receiving for that price. For example, not all kits include a foundation or trailer. Others might only provide with the materials need to build the shell and leave you without an interior. For these reasons, it’s essential that you know exactly what you’re getting when comparing different tiny house kits. 

It’s also important to know that a kit only constitutes for about 25 to 35 percent of the cost of the entire project. There are still some elements that need to be considered as they will likely require a professional, such as your electric and plumbing connections. Unless you have experience in these fields, the cost of hiring someone will significantly contribute to the overall cost of your tiny home. So will any construction workers you need to hire, tools that you rent or buy, and the charge of the lot you will be building on. 

There are ways to [get around these additional costs](https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/how-to-save-money-when-building-your-tiny-house/), but it’s important that you understand the cost of these kits won’t be the final cost of your tiny house. If you’re still eager to become part of the tiny house community, here are some of the best kits on the market today:

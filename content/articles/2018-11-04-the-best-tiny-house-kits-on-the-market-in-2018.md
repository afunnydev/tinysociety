Building a tiny house from scratch takes time and patience. Unless you’re a professional contractor, the planning process alone can quickly become overwhelming. It’s for this reason that many people who are interested in this lifestyle choose to start with a tiny house kit. You still get the hands-on experience of building your own home, but the kit comes with everything you need. Well, almost everything.

Here’s a look at everything you need to know to help you with your decision as well as some of the best tiny house kits on the market today. 

## Things to Know Before Building a Tiny House Using a Kit

There are still some elements that need to be considered as they will likely require a professional, such as your electric and plumbing connections. Unless you have experience in these fields, the cost of hiring someone will significantly contribute to the overall cost of your tiny home. So will any construction workers you need to hire, tools that you rent or buy, and the charge of the lot you will be building on.

When it comes to choosing the right tiny house materials to use for your new home, it’s best to prioritize your needs. Ask yourself if the price is the most important aspect to you or if you will spend a little more to ensure your new home is eco-friendly. If you are building a tiny house on wheels, then you’ll likely prefer using lightweight materials to make it easier to tow. Take a look at these material lists based on different priorities to help you better decide what kind of tiny house you want to build.

When you’re looking to build your tiny house at the lowest cost possible, the materials you use can make all the difference. Since you’re building on a budget, you’ll want to start collecting materials early. Even if you don’t plan to start building for a few months, you’ll want to start your search now and ensure you get the lowest prices. 

### Tips For Finding Budget Materials

* Check local junkyards for salvaged materials.
* Use materials you already have and can repurpose.
* Find recycled materials for low-cost flooring, siding, insulation, etc.
* Check on Craigslist, Amazon, and eBay for free or cheap supplies.
* Take advantage of local garage sales.
* Borrow tools and buy materials off of friends. 
* Keep track of demolition sites nearby.
* Shop at nonprofit stores like the[ Habitat Restore](http://www.habitat.org/restores).

These are a list of materials you will need to purchase to build the frame of your tiny house. The frame consists of the basic structure and does not apply to the interior. 

### Trailer

A trailer is only necessary if you plan to build your tiny home on wheels and tow it with a truck. Depending if you buy one new or used, as well as the size of the trailer, you can expect to pay anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand. While buying used can save you some money, it’s important that you don’t purchase a trailer that appears to be rusting, or you’ll end up having to spend far more on damages when your house falls off of it. 

**Average Cost: $200-$6,000**

### Lumber

The structural frame of your tiny house will likely be built out of lumber. Depending on the size of the home you’re building, the average cost of the wood, screws, and sheathing is $3,000. If you need to hire help to put together the structure, you’ll likely need to add a few hundred dollars to this cost. However, if you use lumber that’s in good shape from someone giving away an old shed or a demolition site, you’ll end up spending far less or nothing at all.

**Average Cost: $0-$3,000**

### Siding

Commonly used siding materials include wood, metal, and vinyl. Since you’re building on a budget, the smartest option is to use any reclaimed materials that you can get your hands on. You might not have the prettiest tiny house, but you’ll save quite a bit! 

**Average Cost: $0-$1,600 **

### Asphalt Shingle Roofing

When you’re working with limited funds, you’ll likely be building your tiny house on your own. If you’re lucky, you’ll get the help of a few friends and family members. When it comes to the roof, you want something not only affordable but one that doesn’t require a professional to install. [Asphalt shingles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072Q8MQ88/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B072Q8MQ88&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=9f6c93334e3805ddb0fc73e37a7b1e5e) are both of these things and are a popular choice for tiny house roofing. 

**Average Cost: $800-$1,000**

### Repurposed Frame Structure

Instead of building your tiny house’s frame out of lumber, use salvaged materials. The most commonly used repurposed structures include storage containers, school buses, and train cars. You can use anything though, so let your imagination go wild! If you can snag a potential structure for free, then you really don’t have anything to lose. 

**Average Cost: $0-$1,000**

### Windows and Doors

When it comes to your tiny house’s windows and doors, it’s crucial to avoid needing custom sizing if you want to stay on budget. You should have these materials all picked out or even purchased before the building process begins. This way, you’re able to include these measurements during the design process. The average cost of second-hand or discounted windows and doors are between $50 and $500, but having to order customized windows can cost you over a thousand dollars. When you’re pinching pennies, you should start off looking on Craigslist and junkyards. If you aren’t looking for anything specific, you’ll easily be able to find windows and doors for your tiny house project for practically nothing. 

**Average Cost: $50-$500**

### Fiberglass Insulation

There are numerous insulation options for your tiny house, but when you’re on a budget, you likely want to go with the cheapest one. Fiberglass comes in large, rolled batts that are pre-cut to fit the standard distance between studs, making them easy to install yourself. It costs on average between $0.64 to $1.19 per foot.

**Average Cost: $145-250**

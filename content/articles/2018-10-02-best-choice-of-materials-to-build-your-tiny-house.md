When it comes to choosing the right tiny house materials to use for your new home, it’s best to prioritize your needs. Ask yourself if the price is the most important aspect to you or if you will spend a little more to ensure your new home is eco-friendly. If you are building a tiny house on wheels, then you’ll likely prefer using lightweight materials to make it easier to tow. Take a look at these material lists based on different priorities to help you better decide what kind of tiny house you want to build.

When you’re looking to build your tiny house at the lowest cost possible, the materials you use can make all the difference. Since you’re building on a budget, you’ll want to start collecting materials early. Even if you don’t plan to start building for a few months, you’ll want to start your search now and ensure you get the lowest prices. 

### Tips For Finding Budget Materials

* Check local junkyards for salvaged materials.
* Use materials you already have and can repurpose.
* Find recycled materials for low-cost flooring, siding, insulation, etc.
* Check on Craigslist, Amazon, and eBay for free or cheap supplies.
* Take advantage of local garage sales.
* Borrow tools and buy materials off of friends. 
* Keep track of demolition sites nearby.
* Shop at nonprofit stores like the[ Habitat Restore](http://www.habitat.org/restores).

These are a list of materials you will need to purchase to build the frame of your tiny house. The frame consists of the basic structure and does not apply to the interior. 

### Trailer

A trailer is only necessary if you plan to build your tiny home on wheels and tow it with a truck. Depending if you buy one new or used, as well as the size of the trailer, you can expect to pay anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand. While buying used can save you some money, it’s important that you don’t purchase a trailer that appears to be rusting, or you’ll end up having to spend far more on damages when your house falls off of it. 

**Average Cost: $200-$6,000**

### Lumber

The structural frame of your tiny house will likely be built out of lumber. Depending on the size of the home you’re building, the average cost of the wood, screws, and sheathing is $3,000. If you need to hire help to put together the structure, you’ll likely need to add a few hundred dollars to this cost. However, if you use lumber that’s in good shape from someone giving away an old shed or a demolition site, you’ll end up spending far less or nothing at all.

**Average Cost: $0-$3,000**

### Siding

Commonly used siding materials include wood, metal, and vinyl. Since you’re building on a budget, the smartest option is to use any reclaimed materials that you can get your hands on. You might not have the prettiest tiny house, but you’ll save quite a bit! 

**Average Cost: $0-$1,600 **

### Asphalt Shingle Roofing

When you’re working with limited funds, you’ll likely be building your tiny house on your own. If you’re lucky, you’ll get the help of a few friends and family members. When it comes to the roof, you want something not only affordable but one that doesn’t require a professional to install. [Asphalt shingles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072Q8MQ88/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B072Q8MQ88&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=9f6c93334e3805ddb0fc73e37a7b1e5e) are both of these things and are a popular choice for tiny house roofing. 

**Average Cost: $800-$1,000**

### Repurposed Frame Structure

Instead of building your tiny house’s frame out of lumber, use salvaged materials. The most commonly used repurposed structures include storage containers, school buses, and train cars. You can use anything though, so let your imagination go wild! If you can snag a potential structure for free, then you really don’t have anything to lose. 

**Average Cost: $0-$1,000**

### Windows and Doors

When it comes to your tiny house’s windows and doors, it’s crucial to avoid needing custom sizing if you want to stay on budget. You should have these materials all picked out or even purchased before the building process begins. This way, you’re able to include these measurements during the design process. The average cost of second-hand or discounted windows and doors are between $50 and $500, but having to order customized windows can cost you over a thousand dollars. When you’re pinching pennies, you should start off looking on Craigslist and junkyards. If you aren’t looking for anything specific, you’ll easily be able to find windows and doors for your tiny house project for practically nothing. 

**Average Cost: $50-$500**

### Fiberglass Insulation

There are numerous insulation options for your tiny house, but when you’re on a budget, you likely want to go with the cheapest one. Fiberglass comes in large, rolled batts that are pre-cut to fit the standard distance between studs, making them easy to install yourself. It costs on average between $0.64 to $1.19 per foot.

**Average Cost: $145-250**

## Utilities On A Budget

Choosing the tiny lifestyle doesn’t mean you have to give up all of the comforts a regular sized house offers. A materials list for your utilities should address all the necessities such as heat and water, as well as a few luxuries like air conditioning.

### Solar Panels

While there are a number of options to supply your tiny house with electricity, you have to consider what will work best for your lifestyle. Solar panels are not just eco-friendly, but they give you more flexibility with where your build (or park) your tiny house. Part of off-grid living is being unplugged from the electric grid, which can be made possible with a [solar power setup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071D9K1BG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B071D9K1BG&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=5e5fd27934f4efd251f90d7702c1da04). While the cost upfront might be more than you’d like, it pays for itself over time as your electric bill will be close to nothing. If you’re building a tiny house on wheels, you’ll want to use a portable solar generator kit so that you have the freedom to travel with them. Homes that are built on land can use a more permanent solar power system. 

**Average Cost: $1,600-$2,800**

### Fresh Water Tank

Every tiny house requires a [fresh water tank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007MSLP7A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007MSLP7A&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=6b92aae1925801f520aaa89747ba8741). This is a container that holds the water that comes out of your sink taps and shower head. You can purchase this tank in numerous sizes, but keep in mind that the smaller your water container is, the more often it will need to be refilled. Since fresh water tanks are usually stored in dark areas, a filter is required to eliminate any bacteria and impurities.

**Average Cost: $40-$100**

### Water Pump

To get your water to flow from your fresh water tank to your faucets and out of your showerhead, you’ll need a basic [water pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W5GCQC2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00W5GCQC2&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=2b696eea8363033036e9429c7d50f35f). They’re on the expensive side, but necessary to have running water in your tiny house.

**Average Cost: $60-$80**

### Grey Water Tank

When you live in a tiny house, you have to create a place for all of your used water to go. This includes the water used to wash your dishes and shower water. Some people choose to collect this water in a [grey water tank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P66C7Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000P66C7Y&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=29dea4e321cf3c19dcde48c538932408) and dump it. Others collect it and use it to water their plants or flowers. Depending on where your house is, you might be able to get away with it running a hose outside into the ground. 

**Average Cost: $50-$175**

### Propane Tankless Water Heater

If you can’t go without regular hot showers, you’re going to need a [tankless water heater](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HRH6T2W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HRH6T2W&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=cce3253ffb9d824a38b55fd7467c89e2) and propane system. This luxury is far from cheap, so you might want to consider skipping it if your budget doesn’t allow for it. The tankless water heater alone costs around $1,200 and a dual propane tank setup will run you around $300.

**Average Cost: $1,100-$1,500**

### Propane Heating

If you choose to splurge for a hot water system that uses propane, then it would be cost effective to use a [propane heating system](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016I0DB5G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B016I0DB5G&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=0440bc3224f3bcde33b2d93b417c935b) as well. These days you can hang a lightweight unit on your wall that’s able to heat your entire house without it taking up too much space. When you’re installing something like this, it’s important to take the unit’s size and weight into consideration.

**Average Cost: $140-$200**

### Air Conditioning

When you’re on a budget, you want to be able to use what you already have. An [air conditioning window unit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W2KG92Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00W2KG92Y&linkCode=as2&tag=mywebsitekb04-20&linkId=0f0cd6facf7f21c9972042401d60bbe5) might not be ideal, as they tend to be chunky, but it’s the most cost-effective option. If you don’t already own an A/C window unit, then you might want to consider spending a little bit more for a compact or mountable unit. 

**Average Cost: $140-$250**

  description: >-
    The unique look of this 196 square foot tiny house dome is that of a smooth
    rock or futuristic structure at Disney World. Made up of fiberglass
    reinforced plastic, this tiny dome can withstand hurricane force winds and
    up to 30 ft of snowfall pressure. The dome-style accomodation is perfect for
    "glamping" or long-term accommodation out in the elements.

## Everything in One

This dome literally has everything under one roof--kitchen, living room, and bedroom. The toilet would need to be either an outhouse or the good ol' fashioned outdoors. The inside of the dome is really quite spacious. Multiple sofas and beds can fit along the curved inner wall. A small wood stove with cooktop has the capacity to heat the space and cook meals at the same time. Multiple windows allow natural light without impacting the strength of the dome. This tiny house dome is truly a force to be reckoned with!

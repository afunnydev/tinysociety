So, you've settled on the fact that you want a moving home. There's still a lot of options in front of you. In this article, I'll explore the process and lifestyle for 2 main categories of options: Tiny House on Wheels vs Van. When using the term "van", I refer to a van in which you can **stand up**, so most probably a Sprinter, Promaster or a Ford Transit.

There are many more options, including buses, smaller caravan or cars. However, to keep the article short and sweet, I'll leave those for another time.

_The purpose of this article is not to determine a "winner", but should help you think about what you want from your movable home_

## Living Space and Organization

Let's face it: living on the road probably means downsizing. The living space will affect your day-to-day life and mood, so make sure that everybody is on board before considering your project.

#### Tiny House on Wheels

Most Tiny House on Wheels are built on a 20' x 8.5' trailer, and go as high as 13.5'. Roughly, once you remove the walls an insulation, you can expect a living space between 120 and 140 square feet. It also gives you a lot of head space, high ceillings or even a loft. That's pretty incredible. With a great choice of colors and a lot of windows, the THoW **will feel really spacious**.

With that much space, you can expect to have a kitchen, a full-fledged bathroom, a loft, a spacious bed and a lot of storage. If you're already careful with the quantity of stuff you own, you probably won't need to throw away anything, or make any compromise.

#### Van

There are a lot of van sizes. Most sizes are compared through their **wheelbase**, which is the distance between the front and the rear wheel. You can find vans with a wheelbase ranging from 124" to 170". Depending on the van you choose, you can expect of living space between 50 and 80 square feet. Yes, it is **significantly** less than a THoW. And it doesn't stop there.

While THoW can go as high as 13.5', most tall vans will have an interior height around 6'. While it suits most people, it's probably not ideal if you're 6' 6". Last but not least, depending on your van model, the van width can go as low as 5.5'. That means that you can't sleep widthwise, and need to sleep lengthwise, cutting on precious space.

As you probably guessed, planning your van's space is a challenge. Most vanlifers still manage to build a space efficient van, fitting surf boards, mountain bikes, shower, toilets. There are a lot of Youtube full build series to help you out.

Choosing vanlife over a THoW probably means a small kitchen, no showers and maybe even no inside toilet. Also, get ready to downsize your possessions to the strict minimum. And if you're diving into this with a partner, make sure that you both understand it could get less glamour sometimes. It's part of the fun.

## Daily Lifestyle and Activities

Owning a movable home litteraly means that everywhere can now be your home. However, it comes with some challenges that are important to consider.
 
- Daily lifestyle
- Capacity to move
- Inviting people over

## Build and Monthly Expenses

Building and living in your moving home is definitely one of the most important aspects to consider. Your budget is probably the biggest (and less flexible) limit to your home project.

### Initial Cost of your Moving Home

Your initial investment includes the vehicle, material and labor to complete the get started on your nomad life.

#### Tiny House on Wheels

The first thing to consider is your vehicle. It goes without saying that you'll need a vehicle to tow your THoW. This impacts the possibilities of your build greatly. The stronger the vehicle, the more weight it can tow, the more flexibility you have. For more information, you can read our article on [towing your tiny house](/articles/what-type-of-truck-do-you-need-to-tow-your-tiny-house/).

The budget for your towing vehicle can vary from $5,000 to as much as $60,000. Let's round this up to approximately $20,000. With that budget, you can get a pretty good second-hand vehicle, or trade-in your vehicle and buy something newer. In any case, please be careful when choosing you vehicle, and remember to consider its fuel consumption if you plan on moving a lot. It can get pretty pricey.

On top of your towing vehicle, you'll also need to build or purchase your Tiny House on Wheels. Most people will go for a 20' x 8.5' x 10' THoW. The cost will also vary a lot, but a good and simple DIY tiny house build will [cost you around $30,000](/articles/how-much-money-does-a-tiny-house-cost/). From that, a significative part is related to your trailer.

I'll not factor in the cost of labor, since we are talking about something DIY here. However, it is worth to notice that the build will most probably take you 2-3 months.

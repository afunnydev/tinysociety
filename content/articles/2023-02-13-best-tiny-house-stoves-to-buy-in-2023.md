Tiny homes are more exposed to the elements than traditional houses, especially if you build one in an elevated location with a great view of the surrounding. This can be a problem, especially in winter, as most tiny homes lack the amenities like HVAC or LPG heating furnaces.

The easiest and the most eco-friendly way to keep your tiny home warm is to get a wood stove. 

Let's see what tiny house stoves are worth getting this year. But before that, let’s answer one key question.

## Why get a wood stove at all?

### Convenience and security

Many tiny homes are built to be portable, so when you move your home to a different location, you don't have to worry about the heating installation. 

With a wood stove, you can keep your living space warm off-grid with no electric power, using available, cheap, or even free fuel, depending on your location. 

Even if you have an electric or propane heater, wood is a great backup heat source when the power goes out, or the propane tank fizzles dry. 

Sourcing firewood is easy in most parts of the world, and you can easily store it in large quantities by just keeping it covered with a tarp.

And in a case of emergency, such as a statewide power outage or extreme weather event, the ability to use locally-sourced fuel for heating can be a lifesaver. 

### Versatility

Many wood stoves have cooking surfaces, so you can use them to prepare food. You can heat water, make your morning breakfast in a cast iron skillet, or cook the stew for dinner on the same stove that provides heat to your home. 

Some stoves have a water boiler or jacket attachment, so you can heat water and distribute it to other areas of your home using radiators. 

A wood stove with a water jacket can also work alongside a solar water heating system to ensure you have hot water throughout the year.

### Dehumidification 

Wood stoves provide a powerful dry heat output, which is important for homes that struggle with moisture control. Humidity can become a serious problem in tiny homes, especially in winter, when condensation accumulates on walls and windows. The best way to prevent mold growth is to use a wood stove and dehumidify the air while heating your home. 

### Ambiance

If I had to choose between watching TV or real fire flickering in my living room on a cold winter afternoon, I'd go with a wood stove. Gather your family and pets around the fire and enjoy the warmth on your skin and the faint smell of wood smoke in the air. 

## How to choose a wood stove for your tiny home?

If you’ve never shopped for a stove before, there are a few considerations to keep in mind.

### BTU rating

When it comes to wood stoves, bigger is not better. Unlike electric furnaces, which have multiple heat settings, wood stove air controls allow you to adjust the burn rate in a narrow range. 

Pick a stove too large, and you'll never be able to burn a regular fire without overheating your home. Get a stove too small, and you'll have to feed your stove round the clock, and even worse, not be able to meet your heating needs.

You have to match your stove to the size of your place, climate, and usage. 

You can use [BTU calculators](https://www.calculator.net/btu-calculator.html) to tell how many BTUs (British Thermal Units) your home needs. Use an average cold winter day for sizing, not the coldest winter day you can remember. This way, you'll avoid going over your needs. 

### Air Controls

Look for a stove with airtight controls, as you'll find it easier to control than a stove that leaks a lot of air. In addition, stoves with several separate air controls allow more precise control over the fire for longer, more efficient burns. 

### Features and accessories

Wood stoves with a top exit have a compact size, which is more suitable for mobile homes. On the other hand, stoves with a rear exit have larger top cooking surfaces. Also, you need to consider whether you would mount your stove directly on the floor, on a wood storage island, or hang it on the wall. 

If your tiny home is more-less airtight, you need a way to supply the fresh air directly to the stove from outside. 

Other features you want to consider are the water heater, heat shield, bake oven,  glass window, black finish, etc. 

### Certifications

If your tiny house is subject to building codes, or you want to insure it, you may need a state-certified wood stove. 

Ask your local code enforcement or insurance company to see your options. Smaller wood stoves, such as camp stoves, are not certified for residential use, which can significantly limit your options.

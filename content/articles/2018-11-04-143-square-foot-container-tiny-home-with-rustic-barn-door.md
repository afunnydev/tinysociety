This particular model boasts a massive glass sliding door that opens up into the split dining/kitchen and bedroom space. The bathroom has its own closed-off section.

## Living Room/Bedroom

This cleverly designed space makes it possible to have both a living room and bedroom at the same time! While a bed fits beautifully into one end of the container, a Murphy bed is also a fantastic option to create additional seating room.

## Bathroom

The full bathroom includes a corrugated-steel shower, vanity, toilet, and mirror--plenty of utility for such a small space! The barn bathroom door that adds privacy to an otherwise open floor plan, is by far our favorite addition.

## Kitchen

The kitchen can be fitted with a solid granite counter top and backsplash. Although the photo shown doesn't include a counter top, we love the fact that you can customize the container to your liking.

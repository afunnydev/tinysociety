The City tiny house is a 143 square feet container tiny house designed by [Alternative Living Space](https://www.alternativelivingspaces.com/). The model is a 20' container built to act as a full time living space, a guest room or as a vacation rental.

The model is divided between one open space for the living room, the kitchen and the bedroom and another closed section for the bathroom.

The space is well designed and includes some hidden storage possibilities and a foldable table to make the most out of the small interior square footage.

The bathroom is separated from the main living space by a custom barn door that adds up to the design of the interior. The shower is also unique using corrugated steel as the primary material!

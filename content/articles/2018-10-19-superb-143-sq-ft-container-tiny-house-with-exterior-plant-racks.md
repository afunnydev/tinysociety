The model is divided between one open space for the living room, the kitchen and the bedroom and another closed section for the bathroom.

## Living Room

The space is well designed and includes some hidden storage possibilities and a foldable table to make the most out of the small interior square footage.

## Bathroom

The bathroom is separated from the main living space by a custom barn door that adds up to the design of the interior. The shower is also unique using corrugated steel as the primary material!

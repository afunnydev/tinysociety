Downtown Las Vegas decided they needed to make use of their plentiful vacant lots. As part of their reinvention, they created a gated tiny home village that thrives in a similar fashion to the Burning Man festival. With fire pits, twinkling lights, and music always playing; this tiny house community is certainly one of the more lively ones. The community is also walking distance from bars, restaurants, and casinos (which might not be ideal for those looking for a quiet retirement). The only downside is that to become a resident, you must be recommended by a current resident.

  description: >-
    Not only does this tiny house look awesome thanks to its triangular design,
    it is also extremely comfortable, cozy and well organized. With its one
    bedroom and one bathroom, this triangular house covers your basic needs and
    much more. 


    And it looks awesome, far from the container style we've been accustomed to
    from tiny houses!

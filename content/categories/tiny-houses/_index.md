## What Are Tiny Houses?

<!-- split -->
There seem to be an incredible amount of houses available to buy on the market, but most of these houses offer a lot of space, too much space (in our opinion, of course). For those who seek a home to come back to everyday that isn’t a vast church, tiny houses are the solution.

The advantage of a tiny house, apart from the fact that it isn’t as big as a modern house, is that you can design it the way you want. The tiny house market is full of DIY house plans, which you can also find here on Kinzi Plans.

That means you can have the house of your dream, designed by yourself for yourself, without having to deal with the cost of a modern house. You can have a house that is efficient, sustainable and very stylish. 

Tiny houses can be made by you or you can also seek the help of professionals. Whatever your preference is, Kinzi Plans can help you fulfill your tiny house dream.

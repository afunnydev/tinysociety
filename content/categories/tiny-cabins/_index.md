## What Are Tiny Cabins?

<!-- split -->
As the name would suggest, tiny cabins are cabins that are tiny. Just like tiny houses, tiny cabins are personalized construction made for specific buyers that want to live in a restricted home space that is designed to be functional and highly efficient: every inch of every foot of the tiny cabin is put to great use. 

Instead of living in an urban area, however, tiny cabins are designed to be constructed in rural areas, like forests, near lakes and rivers, and in fields.

They have everything you need: from the bedroom to the washroom to the kitchen and even to the living room, tiny cabins offer you the same amount of accomodation as a any other cabin. 

Nowadays, some cabins have Wifi, are very well isolated and offer all sorts of commodities that you wouldn’t find in a cabin of 20 years ago. Tiny cabins can also offer you the modern experience of a modern cabin, but in a tiny format.

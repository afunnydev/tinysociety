# Kinzi Plans - About us

## About Kinzi Plans

Kinzi plans is more than just a plans website. We are dedicated to provide the best plans in the industry with a special care for your personal specifications. More than a professional service provider, Kinzi plans wants to provide a conscious way of thinking when starting the construction. Building a house is one of the biggest project a single person gets in his life. We think that building conscientiously is important for the ecosystem we live in and for the world we leave for our children. We promote a minimalist way of living, that resonates well with tiny house plans.

Since day one, architects working with us made plans that they would love to use for their own home. Now we want to innovate to give you the latest innovations in the tiny house industry!

We pride ourselves on the houses built using our plans. We know you work hard and we want to make your work simpler. Why did we build Kinzi plans in the first place? We wanted a place where you can buy plans that are easy to build and understand. If you want to know more about us, our way of doing work or our team, you can call us, email us or contact us on the live chat.

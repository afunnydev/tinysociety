  title: Simplistic Solar Tiny House
  description: >-
    This house is called Simplistic Tiny House, because it looks simplistic: it
    is on wheels, it has a container shape, it has windows near the roof. It's
    pretty much what you would expect from your standard tiny house! 


    What you wouldn't expect is the cleverness of its inside, how the kitchen,
    the laundry, the bathroom, the room and the living room are all
    intelligently disposed to maximize the space and the comfort. You should
    take a look!

  faq:
    - question: How much will this tiny house cost to build?
      answer: >-
        The cost to build your tiny home will vary depending on factors such as location, quality of finishing materials, modifications, etc. Included in your tiny house plans you will receive a materials list. The prices are not included in this list due to the fact that prices may vary, and you may end up substituting materials. What you can do, however, is chat with a qualified builder to get a more accurate cost to build estimate. 
    - question: What modifications can I make to a tiny house plan?
      answer: >-
        You can modify any of the plans that we offer. While some modifications can be done with only minor adjustments to the tiny house plan, others may require us to go back to the drawing board. The costs of your desired modifications depend on the alterations in question. Feel free to <a href="https://www.tinysociety.co/contact-us/">contact us</a> with any modification requests, and we will do our best to work with you to get the best result! 


        Here are some common modifications: Square footage adjustments, Adjusting ceiling height, Adjusting roof pitch, Adding or eliminating windows and doors, Adding or eliminating porches, Adding or eliminating rooms, Changing the siding material, Changing the kitchen layout, Changing materials used inside the house
    - question: How many times can I use your plans to build a tiny house? Can I use a single plan set for multiple constructions?
      answer: >-
        You may only build one tiny house per set of purchased plans. In other words, you can’t use a single plan set to build multiple constructions. This has to do with the licensing agreement that you make upon purchase. If you’re unsure about how you’re using the plans, please feel free to get in touch!
    - question: How many sets of plans do I need to buy to build my tiny house?
      answer: >-
        When it comes time to assemble your build team, you’ll want to have enough plan sets for everyone to get the job done. You’ll notice we offer three different plan set options:


        - **PDF set:** ideal for electronic delivery and easy to print as many copies as you need

        - **5 copy set:** 5 printed copies sent to you by mail

        - **CAD set:** ideal for advanced modifications by an architect 


        The instantly downloadable PDF option is popular because you can easily make copies as needed. If you’re still unsure, you can contact your local municipality or building department to find out exactly how many copies you’ll need.
    - question: Are your plans ready to submit to my building department for permitting?
      answer: >-
        Laws and permit requirements vary depending on where you live. It’s a good idea to speak to someone from your local building department prior to starting the build so you’ll know exactly what to submit. 


        *Keep in mind:* each of our plans may have a different designer--what’s included in each plan option may vary slightly from one to another. When looking at a tiny house plan on our website, be sure to check out the section ‘What’s included in this plan set?’ for specifics. 
    - question: Why should I buy my plans from you?
      answer: >-
        - Pre-set tiny house plans such as the ones we offer, have often been built before or have been perfected by an experienced architect.This means that any issues have been adjusted and resolved to make it a smoother process for you! 

        - Hiring an architect to design a house plan from scratch takes an enormous amount of time and money. You can save both by choosing a set tiny house plan that can be customized to your liking. 

        - Instant delivery! You can download your tiny house plans immediately after purchase, or have them sent to you within a few days. 

        - The highest quality tiny house plan. Our tiny house architects are experienced designers who only create the finest homes. 

        - If you don’t see anything you like--get in touch! We can customize any plan for you.
    - question: What is the difference between creating my own tiny house plans and buying one from your website?
      answer: >-
        Besides saving you time and money, we also provide you with access to expert advice. If you aren’t an architect, you may run into issues or make mistakes that compromise the structural integrity of your tiny home. To avoid all of that, it’s always best to trust the experts. With our tiny house plans you get access to advice, a full materials list, and a whole lot more!

    - question: How do I know what kind of vehicle is needed to tow my tiny house on wheels?
      answer: >-
        A seldom remembered part of the tiny house on wheels process is finding the right tow vehicle. When shopping for a tow vehicle, you’ll want to know exactly how much weight you’ll be hauling. And no, your mini cooper probably isn’t going to cut it. It’s important that you get a vehicle that has the hauling capacity to tow the weight of your tiny house, trailer, and everything in it. There are four main classes of tow vehicles on the market:


        - Light-to-medium-duty: towing capacity of approximately 3,500 lbs

        - Medium-to-heavy-duty: towing capacity of approximately 3,500-5,000 lbs

        - Heavy-duty to Extra heavy-duty: towing capacity of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 lbs

        - Super heavy-duty: towing capacity of approximately 10,000+ lbs


        When looking at tow vehicles, you’ll want to consider your lifestyle. Will I be on the highway for long stretches? Do I plan to go off the beaten path? There are tow vehicles out there to suit every lifestyle. Here are a few of the most popular models:


        - **Jeep Grand Cherokee:** A popular car for families; this SUV is excellent for both highway driving and going off-road. 
        *Towing capacity:* 7,400 lbs

        - **Ford F-150:** Great gas mileage, spacious seating--what more could you want?
        *Towing capacity:* 13,200 lbs

        - **Chevrolet Colorado:** The turbo-diesel option results incredible fuel economy for a truck of this size. 
        *Towing capacity:* 7,700 lbs


        **Please note:** the towing capacities of the mentioned vehicles are based off of 2018 models. The same car of an older make can still do the job. Be sure to ask the right questions when purchasing your tow vehicle.

    - question: Do I need a printed version of the plans?
      answer: >-
        Before the build process you’ll want to be sure to have enough copies for everyone involved. Before getting started, it’s a good idea to check with your local building department to find out how many copies you’ll need. We offer the following options for plans purchase:


        - **PDF set:** ideal for electronic delivery and easy to print as many copies as you need

        - **5 copy set:** 5 printed copies sent to you by mail

        - **CAD set:** ideal for advanced modifications by an architect 


        While your needs may vary, the PDF set is a popular option because it allows you to print as many copies as you would like!
    - question: What is the difference between right reading reverse and mirror reverse?
      answer: >-
        Right reading reverse refers to when the floor plan is flipped right to left, but all the text and dimensions are still able to be read correctly. Mirror reverse plans are the same, but the main difference is that the text and dimensions are going to be backwards (not very convenient!)


        A common reason why someone would use the right reading reverse plans, would be if they wanted to build the exact mirrored version of the house. In other words, the house would be flipped so the side door would be on the opposite side of the house. 


        <a href="https://www.tinysociety.co/contact-us/">Contact us</a> if you would like to receive a copy of the right reading reverse plans with your order.
    - question: What is the materials list and what does it include?
      answer: >-
        The materials list is a list of everything needed to build your tiny house using the purchased plan. By showing this list to an experienced builder, you’ll be able to get a quote for the cost to build. 


        **Please note:** the following is a sample list and not an exact list of you will need to build. You will receive the complete list (including material dimensions) upon purchase of a set of tiny house plans. Here is a sample material list to help you get an idea of what it includes:

        
        - Concrete
        
        - Wood pole
        
        - Wood bearer
        
        - Header joist
        
        - Plywood
        
        - Floor board
        
        - Insulation
        
        - Sill / top plate
        
        - Stud
        
        - Mineral fiber insulation
        
        - Wood furring strips
        
        - Wood cladding
        
        - Plaster
        
        - OSB
        
        - Rafter
        
        - Vapour barrier
        
        - Roof drain
        
        - Master turbine
        
        - Three panel sliding window
        
        - Double glazed door
        
        - Single frame window
        
        - Inside door
    - question: How is the square footage calculated?
      answer: >-
        To calculate the square footage, simply measure the length and width of your space. Next, multiply the length by the width to get the area. If you measured in feet, then the area would be your square footage. Keep in mind; this calculation is based off of a single rectangle. If you have a tiny house plan with several sections, it’s a good idea to calculate the square footage for each section separately. You can then add them together to get a total square footage. 


        Example: Width = 8 ft. Length = 24 ft. Length x Width = Area. 24ft x 8 ft = 192 square feet
    - question: How do I choose the right plan for my project?
      answer: >-
        Before choosing a tiny house plan, ask yourself the following questions:


        - Do I want a <a href="https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-on-wheels-or-stationary-tiny-house/">tiny house on wheels or a tiny house on foundations</a>?
        
        - Where will my tiny house be located?
        
        - What are the <a href="https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-laws-united-states/">tiny house laws</a> of the area where I want to live?
        
        - Do I plan to live off-grid?
        
        - How many people will live in my tiny house?
        
        - Do I want a loft?
        
        - What is my architectural style of choice?
        
        - Can I see myself living in this tiny house, and can it suit my lifestyle needs?


        Ultimately, choosing the right tiny house plans is no different to choosing a regular set of house plans. You want to be certain of your choice, and to do that, you must do the research and ask plenty of questions!

    - question: Can I build the tiny house myself?
      answer: >-
